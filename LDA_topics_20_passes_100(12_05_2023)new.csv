49,55,PA19/03953,Outline planning (with all matters reserved) for up to ten dwellings. Demolition of dwellinghouse and separate annexe,13/05/2019,"1.Policy 3 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 does not support housing  development  that physically extends development into open countryside. Paragraph 2.33 of the Local Plan defines open countryside  as the area outside of the physical boundaries of existing settlements. In terms of rounding off, paragraph 1.68 of the Local Plan explains  that rounding off for the purposes of Policy 3 applies  to development  on land that is substantially enclosed but outside of the settlement and where its edge is clearly defined by a physical feature that also acts as a barrier to further growth.  Furthermore,  it is explained that rounding off should not visually  extend building into the open countryside.  The majority  of the application site is part of existing  agricultural fields and while it would  be possible to construct a rear boundary  to the application site to act as barrier to future development, the proposal  would  still appear  visually  as encroachment of development  into the countryside. The proposal would cause an encroachment of built development  with related car parking  and domestic  paraphernalia into the countryside  beyond the settlement  boundary. In this way the proposal would harm the character and appearance of the area. This harm would fail the requirement of the National  Planning  Policy Framework (2019) that decisions should contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment  by recognising the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside. The proposal would not provide  a suitable  site for housing because of conflict  with the policies  of the development plan and the harm to the character and appearance of the area. In particular the proposal would conflict with policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall  Local Plan Strategic  Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraph 170 which recognises the intrinsic character  and beauty  of the countryside.

As such,  the proposed  development does not accord  with Policy  1 of the Cornwall  Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 as it is not considered to be sustainable development due to its location in the open countryside.    In addition, the proposal would  not accord with policy 1 of the Cornwall Sites Allocations Development Plan Document as it would not constitute a windfall  development  as defined in the said document  and paragraph 8 of the National  Planning Policy Framework  2019. 2 Given its rural setting in the open countryside, the construction of a dwelling, together with its widened  access parking  and external  domestic paraphernalia normally associated with such development, would  lead to unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area.  Whilst the site is not within  any designated landscape area and that enhanced landscaping could soften  the urbanising effects of the new dwelling, the encroachment  of built development into the countryside  would  nonetheless have an adverse impact on the character  and appearance  of the area.  Accordingly, the proposed development would  conflict with policies 1, 2,12 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies  2010-2030. Together  these polices require new development  to maintain, respect and enhance Cornwall's special character including  the impact of the development on its landscape.

It is considered that the design  and appearance  of the proposed development  is not sympathetic to local character, including  the landscape character of the AONB in this highly sensitive  and prominent location,  and the character of the local built environment,  and fails to promote local distinctiveness, by reason of its starkly contemporary  design, including its box-like angular form with strong horizontal emphasis mounted on a stone-faced plinth, flat roofs, expansive areas of glazing  on the southern elevation, which taken together is considered to be out of character with the majority  of the existing built environment  in the immediate vicinity. When  viewed from the adjacent public highway  the development would  appear as a stark contrast to the more traditional forms and designs of the buildings in the immediate  vicinity  and would be out of character in the streetscene to the detriment  of the character  and appearance  of the area and harmful to the natural beauty of the AONB. The expansive glazing on the southern  elevation is also likely to result in reflections during the daytime and light pollution when the building is lit internally  during  hours of darkness  to a greater extent  than is the case with the existing situation due to the significantly increased amount  of glazing,  which would  adversely  affect the natural  beauty of the AONB.

The development therefore represents an undesirable and sporadic  extension of the built form into the adjoining countryside, with no logical barrier to further  growth, which will lead to the erosion of the character and appearance  of the natural environment, as well as eroding  the gap between  the historically separate settlements  of Burnwithian and St Day. The land currently forms  an attractive rural setting,  offering expansive views  over the natural landscape  to the west; the reduction of this significant gap between the separate  entities of Burnwithian and St Day would cause material  harm  to the amenities of the area. This impact is exacerbated through the significant massing of the property  and extent  of the proposed site which fails to demonstrate  an understanding of the surroundings.

It is considered therefore that the development is not sustainable and contrary  to Policies 2, 12, 16 and 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies  2010-2030, Connecting Cornwall 2030 and the aims and intentions of paragraphs  8, 91, 102, 103, 108, 110, 127, 148, 150, 181 of the National Planning Policy Framework. 2 In the absence of robust survey  data, the proposal has failed to demonstrate the level of ecological impact resulting from the development nor the ability to mitigate or compensate impacts to a level that accords  with Policy 23 1., 3., 3.d) of the Cornwall  Local Plan Strategic Policies  2010-2030,  and the proposal  fails the derogation tests in respect  to dormice and bats causing conflict  with The Conservation of Habitats  and Species Regulations 2017.  It is not considered that the proposal in respect to its environmental dimension  constitutes sustainable development. 3 The application has not been accompanied with evidence that active marketing has taken place prior to the submission of the application and so fails to demonstrate there is no market demand  for this business contrary  to Policy  5 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic  Policies 2010-2030.  Without  evidence of the lack of demand  for this business space,  it cannot be concluded  that the loss would be outweighed  by the economic  benefits of the development through employment during the construction phase  and local spend of the future occupiers of the housing.  It is considered therefore  that the proposal  does not in its economic dimension contribute to sustainable development and is conflicts with Policies 5 (2.) of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic  Policies 2010-2030.",Smallscale Major Dwellings,,"Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,Cornwall Local Plan",,,"['fail', 'safe', 'suitable', 'desirable', 'pedestrian', 'cycle', 'movements', 'objectives', 'enhance', 'active', 'travel', 'pattern', 'improve', 'access', 'public', 'transport', 'encourage', 'modal', 'shift', 'away', 'private', 'motor', 'vehicles', 'interest', 'reduce', 'resource', 'consumption', 'quality', 'improvement', 'maintain', 'highway', 'safety', 'sustainable', 'connect', 'absence', 'robust', 'survey', 'data', 'fail', 'level', 'ecological', 'ability', 'mitigate', 'compensate', 'level', 'accord', 'strategic', 'fail', 'derogation', 'test', 'respect', 'dormice', 'bat', 'cause', 'conservation', 'habitats', 'species', 'regulations', 'respect', 'environmental', 'dimension', 'sustainable', 'accompany', 'evidence', 'active', 'market', 'take', 'place', 'prior', 'submission', 'fail', 'market', 'demand', 'business', 'strategic', 'evidence', 'lack', 'demand', 'business', 'space', 'conclude', 'loss', 'outweigh', 'economic', 'employment', 'construction', 'phase', 'spend', 'future', 'occupiers', 'economic', 'dimension', 'contribute', 'sustainable', 'strategic']","['fail', 'safe', 'suitable', 'desirable', 'pedestrian', 'cycle', 'movements', 'objectives', 'enhance', 'active', 'travel', 'pattern', 'improve', 'access', 'public', 'transport', 'encourage', 'modal', 'shift', 'away', 'private', 'motor', 'vehicles', 'interest', 'reduce', 'resource', 'consumption', 'quality', 'improvement', 'maintain', 'highway', 'safety', 'sustainable', 'connect', 'absence', 'robust', 'survey', 'data', 'fail', 'level', 'ecological', 'ability', 'mitigate', 'compensate', 'level', 'accord', 'strategic', 'fail', 'derogation', 'test', 'respect', 'dormice', 'bat', 'cause', 'conservation', 'habitats', 'species', 'regulations', 'respect', 'environmental', 'dimension', 'sustainable', 'accompany', 'evidence', 'active', 'market', 'take', 'place', 'prior', 'submission', 'fail', 'market', 'demand', 'business', 'strategic', 'evidence', 'lack', 'demand', 'business', 'space', 'conclude', 'loss', 'outweigh', 'economic', 'employment', 'construction', 'phase', 'spend', 'future', 'occupiers', 'economic', 'dimension', 'contribute', 'sustainable', 'strategic']",,,,0.1296505630016327,,0.3320339620113373,,,,,,0.08372810482978821

It would  also provide a poor standard of amenity  for future residents of the building.  By reason of its two storey  scale and design and use of materials the proposed development would cause  material  harm  to the designated  and undesignated  historic asset.  The development would  be an incongruous  and contrived  addition  to the street scene in this location and would  clearly  not add to the overall quality of the area and would not sufficiently integrate with the historic environment of this part of Illogan Churchtown.  It is considered that whilst less than substantial harm, the setting of surrounding heritage  assets,  including  the Listed buildings will be harmed by a proposal  of such poor design and scale in this prominent location.

Due to the topography of the area, surface water  run off originating from higher  land is directed towards  the proposed site and existing dwellings.   The Local Authority also has knowledge of drainage patterns in the area. Based on this, the LLFA questions the EA surface water mapping predictions as it would  appear that flooding occurs during lesser events than the 1 in 1000 year prediction.  The Flood Risk Assessment provided to support this application has investigated the flooding issues  and mitigation  measures have been suggested. These measures could aid in the management  of existing surface  water run off flows and so provide some betterment on the current  situation.  However,  betterment is proposed by mitigation  works on third party land and the owners  of this land have objected to the proposed  development  and submitted representations that they would  not allow drainage works on their properties.   The sequential  test has been undertaken and the proposal  would  fail this as there are sites in the parish that could  accommodate this scale of housing  that would  not result in the flooding issues which have been evidenced. The proposal would  thereby fail to provide  a deliverable solution  to the flooding from surface water  to existing residential properties and the highway.

The site's location and scale of development does not constitute infill development or rounding off nor utilise previously  developed land and the site is not allocated in the Gwinear-Gwithian Parish Neighbourhood Plan.  The settlement is considered suitable for housing on a rural exceptions basis where housing development is responsive to local circumstances  in reflecting local housing  needs and be affordable housing led. However the scheme  is not considered to be a Rural Exception Site as the scale of the development in relation to the settlement  is beyond what is considered a small scale rural exception  site (70 dwellings represents approximately an 13% increase to the number  of dwellings in Connor Downs as at 2011).  Although the proposal  offers social  and economic  benefits through housing delivery  including affordable units in this village location  (which are positive  material  considerations supported within the National Planning Policy  Framework) these  do not outweigh or justify a departure from the spatial  strategy pursued  by the Development Plan. The proposal  is therefore  not considered to constitute  sustainable development as defined by the Development  Plan as it conflicts with GGP Policy  2 - Connor Downs - Rural Exception Housing Sites of the Gwinear-Gwithian Parish Neighbourhood Plan 2016-2030,  Policies 1, 2, 3, 9 and 21 of the Cornwall Local Plan and guidance within paragraphs 8, 11 and 15 of the National  Planning Policy Framework 2018. 2 In the absence of a mechanism  to secure it, the proposal fails to provide; affordable housing for which there is an identified need; the future  maintenance of on-site public open space; and off-site  financial contributions to deliver improvements to mitigate pressures  on education and local sports infrastructure provision, children's play area or equipped facilities.

The application site is not an allocated site for development,  does not constitute  windfall under Policy 3 nor the exceptions for residential development in the countryside under Policy  7, has not demonstrably passed the sequential test pursuant to Policy 4, nor the provisions of Policy  5 1. a) - d) and 4. in respect to employment land.  The scale of the proposed  development is so substantial  that it is considered that the granting of permission would  prejudice  the community-led Neighbourhood Plan process by determining decisions about the scale and location of new development around the town. Planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate  otherwise.  In this case the material  considerations  in respect  to accessibility  and landscape impacts are such that a departure from the development plan is not justified at this time particularly as the Council  is able to demonstrate an up to date development plan based on a 5 year land supply position (as required by the NPPF) and in addition  this is supported by delivery rates, consents  and completions for the town which demonstrate  that the local plan targets will be met. The proposed development  is contrary to Policy 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the adopted Cornwall  Local Plan and guidance  contained within  paragraphs 2, 12, 15, 86, 90 of the National Planning Policy Framework and the long standing fundamental of the UK planning system  namely utilising a plan led approach  to development. 2 Due to the failure to demonstrate safe, suitable  and desirable  pedestrian and cycle movements from the site to Wadebridge across the A39, it is considered that residents and those working at the site would  be likely to rely unduly on the use of private motor vehicles to access  the services and facilities. This would be in conflict  with the social  role of sustainability,  as well as the environmental role, which seeks to move to a low carbon economy and less reliance on the private  motor vehicle.  There is considered to be limited physical or functional  relationship with any established settlement and whilst  other  uses have been incorporated into the scheme there are no delivery mechanisms  for such uses, which unless the wider masterplan area is delivered are unlikely  to come forward  sufficient to aid internalisation  of trips for new residents  and existing residents  of Bodieve. It is considered therefore that the development is not sustainable and contrary to Policies  2, 3, 5 and 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan, the aims and intentions of paragraphs 8, 91, 102, 103, 108, 110 and 127 of the National  Planning Policy Framework and guidance  on accessibility limits  in Manual for Streets 1 and 2 (DETR). 3 The site relates to the open countryside and is significant  in terms of both landscape character,  visual  amenity and also has a high value  in creating  the natural extent of the visual setting of Wadebridge and is productive agricultural  land.  The A39 currently forms a strong edge limiting  the spread  of the built up DATED:  31 January  2019 Louise  Wood  -   Service Director Planning and Sustainable Developmentarea of the settlement.  This site breaches this clearly defined edge and much  of it is prominent in the surrounding landscape.

It  will also result with felling and/or harm to mature trees, including  encroaching into the Root Protection Area of two Monterey Pines (T1 and T3) and a Sessile Oak (T5) and the felling of a group of Leyland Cypress  (G2) and a Sessile Oak (T5).

This junction is constrained by poor emerging visibility.  In the absence of information to demonstrate otherwise, a safe and suitable  access  to the development  is therefore not provided and the application is contrary to Policy 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraph 108 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019. 3 The application fails to comply with the habitat  directives in that there is no overriding public interest  for the proposed permanent loss of a bat roost together  with the disturbance of bats.

271,306,PA17/03837,Outline planning permission for the residential development of up to 300 homes with all matters reserved,21/04/2017," 1 Policy 3 of the Cornwall Local Plan states that the delivery  of housing,  retail and employment growth in main towns will be managed through site allocations  in order to ensure that growth  is genuinely plan-led. The application site is not an allocated site for development,  does not constitute  windfall under Policy 3 nor the exceptions for residential development in the countryside under Policy  7. The scale of the proposed development is so substantial that it is considered that the granting of permission would  prejudice  the community-led Neighbourhood Plan process by determining decisions about the scale and location of new development around the town. Planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate  otherwise.  In this case the material considerations  in respect  to accessibility  and landscape impacts are such that a departure from the development plan is not justified at this time particularly as the Council  is able to demonstrate an up to date development plan based on a 5 year land supply position (as required by the NPPF) and in addition  this is supported by delivery rates, consents  and completions for the town which demonstrate  that the local plan targets will be met. The proposed development  is contrary to Policy 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the adopted Cornwall  Local Plan and guidance  contained within  paragraphs 2, 12, 15, 86, 90 of the National Planning Policy Framework and the long standing fundamental of the UK planning system  namely utilising a plan led approach  to development. 2 The proposed development would further increase traffic congestion on the road network, specifically at the junction of Bodieve  Road/Gonvena  Hill/St Matthews Hill.  The applicant has failed to secure  appropriate mitigation for deliverable improvements within the transport network within the foreseeable future in advance of the likely timeframe of the proposal being  occupied.  The resultant residual congestion is considered  to be severe  for the purposes of the NPPF and which would severely inconvenience road users and have associated environmental impacts.  The proposed  development  is therefore not considered to be sustainable development and would therefore be contrary to saved policy DVS5 of the North  Cornwall District Local Plan 1999, Policy 27 of the Cornwall  Local Plan and paragraph 109 of the National  Planning Policy Framework 2019. 3 The site is considered to be countryside and is significant  in terms of providing positive landscape character, visual amenity  to and from the setting of the AONB.  The  proposal would represent  substantial new residential development  into to this locally important  green buffer and would accordingly result in harm to the intrinsic landscape  character,  the setting  of the AONB, whilst  the degree  of harm cannot be fully assessed due to the application being  outline,  policy requires great weight to be attributed to preserving the setting of the AONB. Given the location of the proposal  site and its conflict with the development Plan,  the impact would not be outweighed  by the benefits of the proposal  in its submitted form and is therefore considered contrary to Policies 2, 23 and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan and saved policy ENV1 and the aims and intentions of paragraphs 172, 193 and 196 of the National Planning Policy Framework.  4 In the absence of a mechanism  to secure the long-term provision of affordable housing, open space, educational  infrastructure, air-quality mitigation for which there is evidence of an identified need, and on and off-site highways works, the proposal is considered to be contrary  to paragraphs 8, 62, 91, 94, 96, 102, 103, 105, 108, 127, 181 of the NPPF, and CC Document - Guidance on s106 Planning Obligations for Education Provision  (April 2012) and Cornwall Local Plan Policies 8, 13, 16, 27, and 28. 5 The proposed residential development  would  be in close proximity to the commercial premises of Daftons, the submitted  noise reports  illustrates that housing in this location  will experience an unacceptable level of noise from this business which cannot be mitigated.  The proposed development would  therefore result in an unacceptable conflict  of uses which will have a detrimental impact  upon the living  conditions  of future occupants.

Introducing  the built form in this area would reduce the openess  of the prominent site and would be contrary to policy  BE11 of the St Ives Neighbourhood Plan which seeks to retain  the existing relationship between plot size and building size.  The three properties and parking  areas would  fail to integrate successfully into the wider locality introducing a significant visual intrusion into this largely  undeveloped  frontage.  The proposal is therefore contrary to policies GD1 and BE11 of the St Ives Neighbourhood Development  Plan 2015-2030, policy  12 of the Cornwall  Local Plan and paragraph 127 of the NPPF 2019. 2 The development  as a result  of its cramped and contrived layout would  fail to provide adequate private  amenity spaces to serve  each of the three units off Bishops Road.

The proposal is thus considered unsustainable  and contrary to policy 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan (2010-2030) and paragraphs  84, 108 and 109 of the NPPF (2019) in that it fails to demonstrate that safe and suitable access for all people  and that it would not cause a significantly  adverse impact  on the local road network that could be managed or mitigated. It would conflict with policies GD1 (e), OS7 and T1 (c) of the St Ives Neighbourhood Plan (2015-2030) in that it would adversely affect an existing Right of Way/footpath  and with paragraph 110 of the NPPF (2019)  in that it does not give priority to pedestrian movements, address the needs of people with disabilities, minimise  the scope for conflict  with pedestrians and vehicles  or allow for the efficient delivery  of goods and access by service and emergency  vehicles. It would also conflict  with policy  RA4 of the Cornwall AONB  Management  Plan (2016-2021)  in that it would  negatively impact on the accessibility of the Right of Way network  within the AONB. 2 Policy 5 (1) (c) of the Cornwall Local Plan  allows for proposals for new employment land and uses in the countryside  where they are of a scale appropriate to their location or demonstrate  an overriding locational and business need to be in that location such as farm diversification.  The existing  property consists of a number of disused semi-derelict  buildings  that do not form part of any active  farming enterprise and no supporting  evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed business venture  could  not be more sustainably accommodated elsewhere  within  the locality, particularly in the nearby  urban  area of St Ives. The proposal therefore  fails to accord with policy 5 and also policies 2 and 21 of the aforementioned Cornwall Local Plan, with policy MD15 of the Cornwall AONB Management  Plan (2016-2011) and with paragraphs 8 and 83 of the NPPF (2019).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          3 The applicant has submitted a Structural survey/report that advises in respect of proposed residential accommodation  (annotated  'kitchenette' on proposed site plan (ref:16023/13 Rev B)) that the building is very overgrown  and access  to it is limited and where visible its stone  walls are generally in a very poor condition.  In respect of the adjoining building (annotated  'managers living accommodation') on the aforementioned drawing the structural report gives no details as to the condition of that building.  Having regard to the lack of information in the structural report in respect of these clearly dilapidated structures it is considered that it has not been adequately demonstrated  they are capable  of conversion without extensive  rebuilding. The proposal  thus conflicts with policy 7 of the Cornwall Local Plan (2010-2030) which allows for the re-use of suitably constructed redundant buildings for residential purposes  that are considered appropriate to retain.  The preamble to policy  7 advises that the appropriateness of buildings for conversion  will depend on their structural  soundness and the IDOX/ability to convert  the building without  the necessity of substantial demolition  or substantial rebuilding operations. 4 The design and scale of the development, particularly  in respect of the increased/extended roof form and light spill, is such that it would  significantly increase the prominence/presence  of the site in the public domain  to the detriment of the character and sensitivity  of the wider rural landscape, which is a designated AONB  AONB. The proposal  would  as such fail to promote local distinctiveness  or conserve and enhance the wider setting of the site or the designated landscape and would  not accord  with policies 2, 12, 21 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan (2010-2030), with policies GD1 (b), BE10 and OS1 of the St Ives Neighbourhood Plan (2015-2030), with policies  CC7, MD9 and MD15  of the Cornwall  AONB Management Plan (2016-2021) or with paragraphs 79, 127, 170 and 172 of the NPPF (2019).",Minor -

The proposal therefore represents  an unsustainable  intrusion  of sporadic housing development  into the open countryside, in a location which will not encourage sustainable modes of travel, with future occupiers likely to be highly dependent  on a private  motor  vehicle. Additionally,  the introduction of a new dwelling will further erode the prevailing rural character  of the area. In the absence of any special circumstances  to justify residential  development in this context, the proposal therefore raises direct conflict  with policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies  2010 - 2030,  policies H1 and D1 of the Feock  Neighbourhood Development Plan 2017 - 2030 and paragraphs 8, 79, 127 and 170 of the National Planning  Policy  Framework  2019. 2 The application does not demonstrate that a safe and suitable  means  of access  can be achieved to serve the site, with insufficient visibility demonstrated.  This is of particular concern  given the increase in vehicular movements to and from the site that can reasonably  be expected to result from the development. The application is therefore  contrary to policy  27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic  Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraph 108 of the National  Planning Policy Framework 2019. 3 The development  relates to a site partially within Flood  Zone 2, and wholly within  an area identified  on Council  mapping  as susceptible  to surface water flooding; Planning Practice Guidance and the National  Planning Policy  Framework  2019 advise that a site-specific  flood risk assessment is required for developments  in such areas. In this case, an appropriate flood risk assessment has not been provided. As such, it has not been demonstrated  that the development, which will introduce a more vulnerable use, is suitably safe from flood risk; neither  has it been demonstrated the development would  not impact  upon flood risk elsewhere. The proposal  is therefore considered contrary  to policy  26 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies  2010 - 2030, policy SC1 of the Feock Neighbourhood Development  Plan 2017 - 2030 and paragraphs 155, 163 and 164 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",Minor - Dwelling,"Feock Neighbourhood Development  Plan 2017 - 2030,Feock  Neighbourhood Development Plan 2017 - 2030","Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,Cornwall Local Plan",,,"['locate', 'clearly', 'outside', 'relate', 'establish', 'clearly', 'definable', 'provision', 'strategic', 'unsustainable', 'intrusion', 'sporadic', 'open', 'countryside', 'location', 'encourage', 'sustainable', 'modes', 'travel', 'future', 'occupiers', 'likely', 'highly', 'dependent', 'private', 'motor', 'vehicle', 'additionally', 'introduction', 'erode', 'prevail', 'rural', 'character', 'absence', 'special', 'residential', 'context', 'direct', 'frame', 'safe', 'suitable', 'mean', 'access', 'achieve', 'serve', 'insufficient', 'visibility', 'particular', 'concern', 'give', 'increase', 'vehicular', 'movements', 'ably', 'expect', 'strategic', 'frame', 'relate', 'partially', 'flood', 'zone', 'wholly', 'identify', 'council', 'map', 'susceptible', 'surface', 'water', 'flood', 'practice', 'frame', 'advise', 'specific', 'flood', 'risk', 'assessment', 'require', 'case', 'appropriate', 'flood', 'risk', 'assessment', 'introduce', 'vulnerable', 'suitably', 'safe', 'flood', 'risk', 'flood', 'risk']","['locate', 'clearly', 'outside', 'relate', 'establish', 'clearly', 'definable', 'provision', 'strategic', 'unsustainable', 'intrusion', 'sporadic', 'open', 'countryside', 'location', 'encourage', 'sustainable', 'modes', 'travel', 'future', 'occupiers', 'likely', 'highly', 'dependent', 'private', 'motor', 'vehicle', 'additionally', 'introduction', 'erode', 'prevail', 'rural', 'character', 'absence', 'special', 'residential', 'context', 'direct', 'frame', 'safe', 'suitable', 'mean', 'access', 'achieve', 'serve', 'insufficient', 'visibility', 'particular', 'concern', 'give', 'increase', 'vehicular', 'movements', 'ably', 'expect', 'strategic', 'frame', 'relate', 'partially', 'flood', 'zone', 'wholly', 'identify', 'council', 'map', 'susceptible', 'surface', 'water', 'flood', 'practice', 'frame', 'advise', 'specific', 'flood', 'risk', 'assessment', 'require', 'case', 'appropriate', 'flood', 'risk', 'assessment', 'introduce', 'vulnerable', 'suitably', 'safe', 'flood', 'risk', 'flood', 'risk']",0.2945842742919922,,,,0.022454310208559036,0.15232782065868378,,0.3335440754890442,,,,

In this case, the application site is not considered  to comply with planning policies concerning new windfall residential development  in this area, and is therefore  considered to be situated in the countryside as opposed  to within the Pool urban area. Furthermore, the site is considered to relate more closely in a physical  and visual sense to the surrounding  countryside rather than the urban area. The proposal is therefore considered to conflict with the aims and intentions  of policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall  Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030; Policy 1 of the Cornwall Site Allocations  Development  Plan Document;  and paragraphs 8, 127 and 170 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019. 2 The application site occupies a prominent position in the local landscape, in-particular when  approaching from Whitcross  Hill to the north-west,  and provides  a pleasant transition from urban to rural as one leaves the Pool urban area. A development of the site is considered to erode  the prominent, natural backcloth provided to the urban  area by the site, in turn failing  to recognise and respect the character, sensitivity and capacity of the landscape  asset, as informed by the 'Redruth, Camborne  and Gwennap' Landscape  Character Area Assessment and the 'Carnmenellis' Area of Great  Landscape Value. The proposal is therefore considered to conflict with the aims and intentions  of policies 1, 2 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies  2010 - 2030, and paragraphs  8, 127 and 170 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019. 3 By reason of the site's positioning within the direct  setting of, and in-between, prominent listed buildings and non-designated heritage  assets which are synonymous with the area's mining heritage  and which contribute to the Outstanding Universal Value of the Camborne  and Redruth Mining District  World Heritage Site, the proposal  is considered to erode  the appreciation  and understanding of the assets, and to in turn fail to preserve the listed buildings  and their setting and the authenticity  and integrity of the Outstanding Universal Value of the World Heritage Site. Furthermore, the submitted  Heritage Assessment has failed to demonstrate otherwise. Whilst the harm to the heritage assets would be less then substantial,  the public benefits of the proposal in terms of the provision of additional  residential units in an area with low strategic  demand is not considered to outweigh  this harm.

the original agricultural use which is not out of character to the setting and is generally accepted as part of the rural landscape. The proposed conversion of the
building including introduction of new glazing, creation of a domestic curtilage, car parking and other associated domestic paraphernalia will give rise to a detrimental change in character thereby harming the character and intrinsic beauty of the countryside.

This overdevelopment is comprised of a cramped form of layout with an unsatisfactory orientation  of housing and living  conditions within  the site in relation to each other, and in relation to boundaries and neighbouring properties; introducing a dominant scale and height of development within the street  scene along St Thomas Road that would have an unsatisfactory relationship to neighbouring properties leading to loss of privacy and amenity; car parking provision that does not provide the minimum  standards on plot required; and overall creating a form of development  that is assessed as out of character  of the established pattern  of development  including taking account  of most recent permission for part of this red line site. This current  proposal is therefore in conflict with Polices  2(1), 12, 13, 16, 21 and 23 of the Adopted Cornwall Local Plan 2010-2030 and Policies D1; G2 and H4 of the Adopted  Newquay Neighbourhood Development  Plan; Paragraph 122 and Chapter 12 of the NPPF (2019) and the Adopted  Cornwall Design  Guide 2013. 2 The current development has not provided percolation  test results,  carried out to BRE Digest 365 standards with plan of trial pit holes and supported  by photographs of the investigation to demonstrate how a sloping site within  Flood Zone 1 can provide a satisfactory means of managing surface  water runoff from the site; and attenuate against  impacts off site especially  to St Thomas Road and properties situated  below  on the north side of St Thomas Road located at a lower level.

In addition, the dominant structure will result  in an overbearing impact on the neighbouring residents along with overlooking of neighbouring garden areas.

The site's location and scale of development  does not constitute infill development or rounding off nor utilise previously developed  land and the site is not allocated for residential development  in the Landulph Neighbourhood Development  Plan 2018-2030.   The settlement  is considered suitable for housing on a rural exceptions basis where housing development is responsive to local circumstances  in reflecting local housing  needs and be affordable housing led.  However  the scheme  is not considered to be a suitable rural exceptions development  as the scale of the development and the number of dwellings proposed  in relation to the very low evidence of identified housing need in the Parish goes beyond  what is considered appropriate.   Furthermore, the submitted information has not demonstrated  that the level of market housing  proposed is essential for the successful delivery of the scheme.  The scheme  also fails to demonstrate that the proposed affordable housing meets the Nationally Described Space Standards and that 25% of the affordable units will comprise accessible homes.  The positioning of the affordable  dwellings across  the site, together with the limited garden spaces  serving  a number  of the affordable units will also fail to create a scheme where the affordable units are indistinguishable from the open market  dwellings, which in contrast comprise large, detached properties (generally) sited in the southern half of the plot, benefiting from generous garden spaces  and garaging.   The proposal is therefore  not considered to constitute sustainable  development  as defined  by the Development  Plan as it conflicts specifically with Policies  1, 3, 9 and 13 of the Cornwall  Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, adopted  November 2016; Cornwall Council Housing Supplementary Planning Document  2020 and guidance within paragraphs  8, 11, 15 and 77 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019. 2 The proposal, by reason of its scale,  density, layout and location,  fails to conserve or enhance the landscape and scenic beauty of the Tamar Valley AONB  AONB.  The proposed development represents major development within the AONB without sufficient evidence of exceptional circumstances and that the development is in the public interest.  The development as proposed  would erode the special qualities and features in this part of the AONB and is therefore contrary to Policy 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan, paragraph 172 of the National Planning Policy  Framework 2019 and the Tamar Valley AONB  Management  Plan 2019-2024. 3 In the absence of a mechanism  to secure the provision  of affordable housing;  public open space on site including  future management and maintenance in perpetuity; offsite financial contributions towards  educational infrastructure and off-site financial contributions to manage the increased recreational impacts on IDOX/the Plymouth  Sound and Estuaries SAC Natura 2000 site the proposal  is contrary to Policies  1, 2, 9, 12, 13, 16, 22, 23, 25 and 28 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and CC Guidance on S106 Planning Obligations for Education Provision 2018.

722,811,PA20/02517,"Construction of Extension, Alterations & Associated Works",07/04/2020," 1 The proposed development comprises the conversion of a modest  two-bedroom  chalet into a two-storey four-bedroom dwelling. The site parameters are extremely constrained with vehicle  and pedestrian access passing the living quarters of the neighbouring  property which  immediately  adjoins the access. The proposed parking provisions  would not allow sufficient space  for the parking and turning of occupants and visitor's vehicles leaving,  resulting in vehicles  having to reverse in excess of 60 metres  along a shared private  access road. The intensified residential  use would  result in an increase in the number of vehicle  movements and pedestrian activity along this road harming the living  conditions of the occupiers  of neighbouring  properties with particular reference to No. 32 Cove View. The proposal  would therefore  conflict  with policy  SD2 of the Hayle  Neighbourhood Plan 2014 - 2030, policies 2, 12 and 13 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 127, 170 and 180 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 which  together seek to provide adequate parking; protect individuals and property  from unreasonable  noise and disturbance by creating places with appropriate  densities  which are safe, inclusive and accessible; and promote  health and well-being with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users. 2 The proposed development includes  an extension of the hard standing situated within the rear garden  to accommodate an increased number  of vehicles using the site. Due to the sloping  topography, the enlarged parking area and parked vehicles would be elevated above the wide stretch of incredibly scenic open coastline to the north-west of the site appearing extremely  prominent from the public right of way route code 102/29/4 which is positioned  on land below and to the rear of the development  site. The rear gardens  serving  the dwellings along Riviere Towans  are characterised by their long and unobstructed  rear gardens  which provide panoramic views over the coastline  below. The inclusion of the low hedge which attempts to conceal the harmful  urban appearance of the enlarged vehicle parking  area would adversely impact the openness  of this garden,  appearing at odds with the prevailing landscape character.

The inclusion of the large detached stables building  east of the existing indoor riding school are not considered to be reasonably necessary  owing to the existing redundant stables  buildings which are situated in a more discrete location, well related  to the existing built form; opportunities exist with the relevant permissions to make more efficient use of land by re-using or replacing  the existing stable  buildings. The extension to the vehicle parking  area through the provision  of a hardstanding fails to commensurate with the scale of the existing authorised  equestrian enterprise.  The outdoor  sand school  to the north of the indoor riding  school  further contributes to the urbanisation of this landscape.  When considered as a whole, the development  would harmfully urbanise the landscape by reason  of the encroachment of the built environment into the open countryside.

The site parameters are extremely constrained with vehicle  and pedestrian access passing the living quarters of the neighbouring  property which  immediately  adjoins the access.

The proposed  inclusion of planting  which is suitably  substantial  so as to conceal the harmful urban appearance  of the enlarged vehicle parking area would adversely impact the openness of this garden,  appearing as an alien feature at odds with the prevailing landscape  character.

The development  is assessed to cause significant  landscape harm within  the wider landscape setting. Notwithstanding  the absence of details  to demonstrate means of vehicular and pedestrian  access to serve  the site, due to the location of the site and proximity to Ox Lane, a means  of access including  visibility splays  would result  in loss of hedgebank creating significant  harm to the landscape and historic characteristics of the western boundary, and the line of trees therein. Also, the lack of any established natural barrier around  the northern, southern and eastern boundaries of this red edged  site, is assessed to cause significant harm conflicting with the character  of the Area of Great Landscape  Value  due to the open nature of the existing  field in the wider context and associated harm that the proposed introduction  of 5 new homes onto this field would have to the distinctive natural  beauty  and character of the area.

The path/byway  over which access  is proposed is substandard  in terms of width, forward  visibility and inter-visible passing.  The access  from the A3058 onto the Green is also of substandard width.  The  proposal would risk conflict  between byway and highways users and there is insufficient land available to provide  mitigation against these  issues.   The proposal would  thereby be contrary to Policy 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030. 2 The site is located in the open countryside and consists of a green field site bordered by hedgerows and trees that contributes towards the distinctive rural setting of the village and the character and appearance of the area when viewed from the Byway and Public Footpath.  The proposal would see the removal of a section of hedge and trees and loss of the green open space to development.  The site does not integrate well with the built up part of the settlement  with only a small proportion  of the site boundary adjoining  the Trewoon Settlement Boundary and the majority of the site adjoining agricultural  land and the byway.

Furthermore,  through  its reduction  of on-street  parking opportunities, the proposal  would  cause a significantly adverse impact upon the local road network, and in turn harmful  disruption to the operation  of: funerals at the adjacent cemetery; the Parish archive housed  in the cemetery chapel; the Parish Council's meetings in the nearby  Tamar Valley  AONB Centre; the operation of that centre itself, and the nearby Fernleigh House  Children's Centre.

Application for Outline Planning Permission with some matters reserved for the construction of an affordable detached single dwelling namely access, scale and layout only.",17/12/2021,"1 The proposed development would constitute a new dwelling in the countryside which conflicts with the aims and intentions of Policies 2, 3, 7 and 9 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 along with Policies LGEN1, GEN2 and LH1 of the Lanlivery Neighbourhood Development Plan 2218-2030. 2 The proposal would give rise to substantial harm to the significance of the World Heritage Site (WHS). As such it would be contrary to Policy 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 which indicates that development within the WHS should accord with the Management Plan and that proposals that would result in harm to the authenticity and integrity of the Outstanding Universal Value should be wholly exceptional. It would also be contrary to paragraph 206 of the Framework where account should be taken to enhance or better reveal the significance of heritage assets along with Policy GEN2 of the Lalivery Neighbourhood Development Plan. 3 The proposal to construct a dwelling on this undeveloped space would lead to a notable degree of harm the character and appearance of the locally designated Area of Great Landscape Value. Without the benefit of a Landscape Visual Impact Assessment it cannot be demonstrated that any harm arising from the development could be mitigated. As a consequence the proposal conflicts with the aims and intentions of Policy 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and saved Policy 14 of the Restormel Local plan along with Policies GEN2 along with Policy LLNE1 of the Lanlivery Neighbourhood Development Plan 2018-2030. 4 Insufficient information and evidence has been provided to justify the size of the proposed dwelling and if the applicant would comply with the affordable housing occupation requirements imposed by S.106 Legal Agreement. Notwithstanding any justification provided for the size of the proposed dwelling (Homechoice does not evidence a need for this size of property), it is considered that its size would be such that it would require significant discount to be affordable for future re_x0002_sale. In light of the above assessment the proposal conflicts with Policy 9 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and Policy LH1 of the Lanlivery Neighbourhood Development Plan 2018-2030. 5 The site falls partially within Flood Zones 2,3 and 3b and within an area susceptible to groundwater and surface water flood risk primarily due to its relationship with the Treffry Canal, Par Canal and Canal Basin running parallel with the southwest boundary. This evidence of flood risk necessitates the application of the sequential test which seeks to ensure that there are no reasonably available sites in Flood Zone 1 before the suitability of sites in Flood Zones 2 or 3 (areas with a high/highest probability of flooding) are considered, taking into account the flood risk vulnerability of land uses and applying the exception test if required. In the absence of a sequential test, it has not been demonstrated on the reasonable availability of other sites suitable for the development which are located within an area at a lower risk of flooding. As a consequence, the location of the site is not acceptable in terms of the risk of flooding, with particular regard to the sequential test. It therefore conflicts with Policies 2, 16 and 26 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 which collectively seek to protect people from unsafe environments and potential hazards, ensure that buildings can adapt and be resilient to climate change and require development to be sited in a manner that increases flood resilience of the area, taking account of the need to avoid areas of flood risk.",Minor - Dwelling,"Lanlivery Neighbourhood Development Plan 2018-2030,Lalivery Neighbourhood Development Plan,Lanlivery Neighbourhood Development Plan 2218-2030",Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,,,"['countryside', 'lgen', 'rise', 'substantial', 'harm', 'significance', 'world', 'heritage', 'indicate', 'accord', 'management', 'harm', 'authenticity', 'integrity', 'outstanding', 'universal', 'value', 'wholly', 'exceptional', 'frame', 'account', 'take', 'enhance', 'better', 'reveal', 'significance', 'heritage', 'assets', 'construct', 'undeveloped', 'space', 'lead', 'notable', 'degree', 'harm', 'character', 'appearance', 'designate', 'great', 'landscape', 'value', 'landscape', 'visual', 'assessment', 'harm', 'arise', 'mitigate', 'consequence', 'save', 'restormel', 'llne', 'insufficient', 'evidence', 'size', 'applicant', 'comply', 'affordable', 'occupation', 'requirements', 'impose', 'legal', 'agreement', 'notwithstanding', 'size', 'homechoice', 'evidence', 'need', 'size', 'property', 'size', 'require', 'significant', 'discount', 'affordable', 'future', 'rexsale', 'light', 'assessment', 'partially', 'flood', 'zone', 'susceptible', 'groundwater', 'surface', 'water', 'flood', 'risk', 'primarily', 'relationship', 'treffry', 'canal', 'canal', 'canal', 'basin', 'run', 'parallel', 'southwest', 'boundary', 'evidence', 'flood', 'risk', 'necesates', 'sequential', 'test', 'seek', 'ensure', 'ably', 'available', 'flood', 'zone', 'suitability', 'flood', 'zone', 'highhighest', 'probability', 'flood', 'take', 'account', 'flood', 'risk', 'vulnerability', 'use', 'apply', 'exception', 'test', 'require', 'absence', 'sequential', 'test', 'able', 'availability', 'suitable', 'locate', 'lower', 'risk', 'flood', 'consequence', 'location', 'acceptable', 'term', 'risk', 'flood', 'particular', 'regard', 'sequential', 'test', 'collectively', 'seek', 'protect', 'people', 'unsafe', 'environments', 'potential', 'hazard', 'ensure', 'adapt', 'resilient', 'climate', 'change', 'require', 'manner', 'increase', 'flood', 'resilience', 'take', 'account', 'need', 'avoid', 'flood', 'risk']","['countryside', 'lgen', 'rise', 'substantial', 'harm', 'significance', 'world', 'heritage', 'indicate', 'accord', 'management', 'harm', 'authenticity', 'integrity', 'outstanding', 'universal', 'value', 'wholly', 'exceptional', 'frame', 'account', 'take', 'enhance', 'better', 'reveal', 'significance', 'heritage', 'assets', 'construct', 'undeveloped', 'space', 'lead', 'notable', 'degree', 'harm', 'character', 'appearance', 'designate', 'great', 'landscape', 'value', 'landscape', 'visual', 'assessment', 'harm', 'arise', 'mitigate', 'consequence', 'save', 'restormel', 'llne', 'insufficient', 'evidence', 'size', 'applicant', 'comply', 'affordable', 'occupation', 'requirements', 'impose', 'legal', 'agreement', 'notwithstanding', 'size', 'homechoice', 'evidence', 'need', 'size', 'property', 'size', 'require', 'significant', 'discount', 'affordable', 'future', 'rexsale', 'light', 'assessment', 'partially', 'flood', 'zone', 'susceptible', 'groundwater', 'surface', 'water', 'flood', 'risk', 'primarily', 'relationship', 'treffry', 'canal', 'canal', 'canal', 'basin', 'run', 'parallel', 'southwest', 'boundary', 'evidence', 'flood', 'risk', 'necesates', 'sequential', 'test', 'seek', 'ensure', 'ably', 'available', 'flood', 'zone', 'suitability', 'flood', 'zone', 'highhighest', 'probability', 'flood', 'take', 'account', 'flood', 'risk', 'vulnerability', 'use', 'apply', 'exception', 'test', 'require', 'absence', 'sequential', 'test', 'able', 'availability', 'suitable', 'locate', 'lower', 'risk', 'flood', 'consequence', 'location', 'acceptable', 'term', 'risk', 'flood', 'particular', 'regard', 'sequential', 'test', 'collectively', 'seek', 'protect', 'people', 'unsafe', 'environments', 'potential', 'hazard', 'ensure', 'adapt', 'resilient', 'climate', 'change', 'require', 'manner', 'increase', 'flood', 'resilience', 'take', 'account', 'need', 'avoid', 'flood', 'risk']",0.020333020016551018,,,,0.027073638513684273,,,0.6946994662284851,,,0.17716898024082184,0.04163576290011406

The extremely close proximity of the proposed Juliet balconies allows for a significant increase in levels of overlooking and disturbance to the users of 17 Boscaswell Village that is considered intrusive, unreasonable and of harm beyond that of the reasonable levels of privacy currently enjoyed at this property. The proposed Juliet balconies would raise concerns relating to the impact upon the occupiers of neighbouring property that are not balanced by other factors acting in the public interest.The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 12 paragraphs 2a and 2c of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 (Adopted 22nd November 2016); Section 2.6 (bullet point 1); Section 4.1 (bullet point 1) and Section 4.11 (bullet point 1) of the Cornwall Design Guide 2013; and paragraphs 126, 130, 132 and 134 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021",Householder,,Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,,AONB,"['enlarge', 'openingsjuliet', 'balconies', 'appear', 'incongruous', 'inappropriate', 'context', 'character', 'exist', 'convert', 'barn', 'materially', 'reduce', 'visual', 'quality', 'stscape', 'fail', 'preserve', 'character', 'appearance', 'boscaswell', 'conservation', 'locate', 'aonb', 'require', 'harm', 'weigh', 'public', 'case', 'harm', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'associate', 'private', 'minor', 'economic', 'insertion', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'appreciate', 'substantial', 'harm', 'relation', 'conservation', 'set', 'act', 'public', 'interestthe', 'design', 'guide', 'accord', 'authoritys', 'statutory', 'duty', 'list', 'conservation', 'preserve', 'enhance', 'character', 'appearance', 'conservation', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'design', 'location', 'unacceptable', 'increase', 'overlook', 'disturbance', 'relation', 'immediately', 'adjacent', 'garden', 'boscaswell', 'village', 'extremely', 'close', 'proximity', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'allow', 'significant', 'increase', 'level', 'overlook', 'disturbance', 'users', 'boscaswell', 'village', 'intrusive', 'unable', 'harm', 'able', 'level', 'privacy', 'currently', 'enjoy', 'property', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'concern', 'relate', 'occupiers', 'neighbour', 'property', 'act', 'public', 'interestthe', 'bullet', 'bullet', 'bullet', 'design', 'guide']","['enlarge', 'openingsjuliet', 'balconies', 'appear', 'incongruous', 'inappropriate', 'context', 'character', 'exist', 'convert', 'barn', 'materially', 'reduce', 'visual', 'quality', 'stscape', 'fail', 'preserve', 'character', 'appearance', 'boscaswell', 'conservation', 'locate', 'aonb', 'require', 'harm', 'weigh', 'public', 'case', 'harm', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'associate', 'private', 'minor', 'economic', 'insertion', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'appreciate', 'substantial', 'harm', 'relation', 'conservation', 'set', 'act', 'public', 'interestthe', 'design', 'guide', 'accord', 'authoritys', 'statutory', 'duty', 'list', 'conservation', 'preserve', 'enhance', 'character', 'appearance', 'conservation', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'design', 'location', 'unacceptable', 'increase', 'overlook', 'disturbance', 'relation', 'immediately', 'adjacent', 'garden', 'boscaswell', 'village', 'extremely', 'close', 'proximity', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'allow', 'significant', 'increase', 'level', 'overlook', 'disturbance', 'users', 'boscaswell', 'village', 'intrusive', 'unable', 'harm', 'able', 'level', 'privacy', 'currently', 'enjoy', 'property', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'concern', 'relate', 'occupiers', 'neighbour', 'property', 'act', 'public', 'interestthe', 'bullet', 'bullet', 'bullet', 'design', 'guide']",,0.41865274310112,,,,,,,0.3310222327709198,,,

The proposed works fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Trewellard Conservation Area, which is located within an AONB and a World Heritage SiteThe National Planning Policy Framework requires harm to be weighed against the public benefit of the proposals. In this case the harm of the proposed two storey extension and balcony has been set out above.  Although the private benefits and minor economic benefits of the extension are appreciated, the proposed works would result in less than substantial harm in relation to the Conservation Area and its setting that are not balanced by these factors or other factors acting in the public interest.The proposal is therefore contrary to the aims and intentions of Policies 1, 2 (paragraphs 1a to 1d), 12 (paragraphs 1a and 1b), 23 (paragraphs 2, 2a and 2b) and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 (Adopted 22nd November 2016); Policy MD9, MD16 and SCW8.04 of the Cornwall AONB Management Plan 2016 - 2021, Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Cornwall Design Guide 2021; Policies AD2, AD3, AD4, BD1 and BD2 of the St Just-in-Penwith Parish Neighbourhood Plan 2021-2030; and paragraphs 126, 130, 134, 176, 178 , 189, 197(c), 199, 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.

The main northwest elevation bank of sunroom windows currently allows for a largely unhindered open outlook, with the subject two storey extension proposed to directly face the sunroom windows, and at close proximity. The currently unhindered open outlook would be replaced with a two storey blank wall and roof, with the resulting impact being regarded as detrimental to the users of the property.

In addition, the proposed flat roofed extension would increase the size of the existing flat roofed garage in a prominent location and would not be sympathetic to the local character including the surrounding built environment. The proposed use and design would not meet a core principle of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, which requires development always to seek to secure a high quality design and good standard of amenity for all existing and future occupants of land and buildings.  The proposal is, therefore, contrary to policies 1, 2, 5 and 12 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, policy LUD7 of the Ludgvan Parish Neighbourhood Plan, section 7 of the Ludgvan Parish Council Parish Design Statement and paragraphs 8, 124, 126 and 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.

The larger green gaps along Red Lane are considered to add significantly to its character and to allow residential development of the site and the need to alter and cut back a significant section of the existing Cornish hedge boundary to form the suitable access and associated visibility splay requirements and access track would represent further, incremental urbanisation of a pleasant, semi-rural lane, thereby unacceptably harming the character and setting of Rosudgeon and Perran Downs and the surrounding countryside in conflict with the aims and intentions of policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030; and paragraphs 8, 130 and 174 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The land was in use by a person/persons with mining connections and that as such would be regarded as a mineworker's smallholding, of which this area has many.

Furthermore, none of the exceptions for new residential development in the countryside would be met. The proposal is therefore considered to conflict with the aims and intentions of Policy AH6(3) of the St Just-in-Penwith Parish Neighbourhood Plan 2021 - 2030, and policies 3(3) and 7 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030. 2 Whilst the application site is bordered by established and mature trees along its boundaries, it is considered that they would unlikely provide substantial screening of the proposed development from the surrounding area at all times of the year. Furthermore, it is considered that an improved scheme of planting along the boundaries would unlikely overcome any harm - indeed, the substantial shading caused by the existing trees upon the proposed dwellings and their outside areas, coupled with the likely desire to achieve countryside views from the dwellings, is likely to increase the pressure for their felling following occupation (despite any tree protection conditions), thereby making the development even more conspicuous, including in the setting of Bosavern House. The proposal is therefore considered to fail to at least conserve the landscape and scenic beauty of the Cornwall AONB, in conflict with the aims and intentions of policies AD1 and BD8 of the St Just-in-Penwith Parish Neighbourhood Plan 2021 - 2030; policies 12 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030; paragraphs 130, 174 and 176 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021; and policies CC7, CC13, MD9 and WP7.05 of the Cornwall AONB Management Plan 2016-2021. 3 Owing to the distinctly domestic appearance and tight and weaving nature of the proposed access through Bosavern House to the application site, it is considered that the proposal would not function well through its poor-quality layout which would fail to provide a clear and legible route to the proposed dwellings from the public highway, and would likely give rise to conflict between existing and future users of land and buildings. The proposal is therefore considered to conflict with the aims and intentions of Policy 12 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 4 The application site appears on historic mapping as curtilage land serving the locally significant and apparently well-preserved Bosavern House and its outbuildings, and the proposal would result in the substantial covering of this land with buildings which would erode the spatial relationship between the site and the non-designated heritage assets, which are considered to be of relatively substantial significance.

The proposal would project development into open countryside and have a suburbanising impact in an oth erwise undeveloped pastoral and rural location.

It is not considered to be in compliance with policies 2, 3, 9 and 23 of the adopted Cornwall Loca l Plan: Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and the provisions of the NPPF 2021.  2 In the absence of a mechanism to secure the provision of financial contributions to mitigate the recreation impact on the Fal and Helford Special Area of Conservation for which there is evidence of an identified need, the proposal is considered to be contrary to policies 22 of the Cornwall Local Plan.  3 Insufficient information has been provided to assess the impact on designated heritage assets and archaeology at the site and the proposal is not considered to be in conformity with policy 24 of the adopted Cornwall Local Plan: Strategic Polices, and paragraphs 194 and 195 of the NPPF 2021.  4 The application fails to comply with the habitat directives in that there is no overri ding public interest for the proposal and there would be a disturbance to foraging and commuting bats.

911,1013,PA21/07964,Construction of home office and associated storage for family business,19/10/2021," 1 The proposed development is for a home office. However, the scale of the proposal is such that the development in effect constitutes the sub-division of the domestic curtilage of the existing residential property to facilitate a business use thus creating a mixed use of the site for both residential and business purposes. New build development in the countryside is strictly controlled though there is some limited policy support for new sustainable business proposals. Specifically, policy 5 of the Cornwall Local Plan (2010-2030) supports employment land and uses in the countryside where the scale of development is appropriate to its location or demonstrates an overriding locational and business need to be in that location or an extension to an existing business where re-location would be impractical or not viable. Policy EX1 of the Hayle Neighbourhood Plan (2014-2030) supports proposals where the development demands a countryside location and paragraph 84 of the NPPF (2021) advises that planning decisions should enable the sustainable growth and expansion of all types of business in rural areas both through the conversion of existing buildings and well-designed new buildings. The applicant has not provided any information to demonstrate a business need for the proposed building to be sited at this rural location, nor any justification for the scale or internal layout of the development. Further to the above, the design of the proposed building is not locally distinctive, is not well related spatially to the existing development on-site and would constitute a prominent, discordant feature in the street scene that would not conserve or enhance the character of the wider open countryside. The development thereby fails to accord with the aims and intentions of the above-mentioned policies and conflicts with policies 1, 2, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan (2010-2030), with policy NE3 of the Hayle Neighbourhood Plan (2014-2030) and with paragraphs 8, 130 and 174 of the NPPF (2021). 2 Insufficient evidence has been provided in regards to surface water disposal to demonstrate that drainage of the development site can be adequately achieved without increasing flood risk elsewhere. In the absence of this information, the proposal is considered contrary to the aims of policy 26 of the Cornwall Local Plan (2010-2030) and paragraph 167 of the NPPF (2021).",All other minor developments,Hayle Neighbourhood Plan (2014-2030),Cornwall Local Plan,,,"['home', 'office', 'scale', 'effect', 'subdivision', 'domestic', 'curtilage', 'exist', 'residential', 'property', 'facilitate', 'business', 'create', 'mix', 'residential', 'business', 'purpose', 'countryside', 'strictly', 'control', 'limit', 'support', 'sustainable', 'business', 'specifically', 'support', 'employment', 'use', 'countryside', 'scale', 'appropriate', 'location', 'override', 'locational', 'business', 'need', 'location', 'extension', 'exist', 'business', 'relocation', 'impractical', 'viable', 'support', 'demand', 'countryside', 'location', 'advise', 'decisions', 'enable', 'sustainable', 'growth', 'expansion', 'type', 'business', 'rural', 'conversion', 'exist', 'welldesigned', 'applicant', 'business', 'need', 'rural', 'location', 'scale', 'internal', 'layout', 'design', 'distinctive', 'relate', 'spatially', 'exist', 'prominent', 'discordant', 'feature', 'scene', 'conserve', 'enhance', 'character', 'wider', 'open', 'countryside', 'fail', 'accord', 'abovementioned', 'insufficient', 'evidence', 'regard', 'surface', 'water', 'disposal', 'drainage', 'adequately', 'achieve', 'increase', 'flood', 'risk', 'absence']","['home', 'office', 'scale', 'effect', 'subdivision', 'domestic', 'curtilage', 'exist', 'residential', 'property', 'facilitate', 'business', 'create', 'mix', 'residential', 'business', 'purpose', 'countryside', 'strictly', 'control', 'limit', 'support', 'sustainable', 'business', 'specifically', 'support', 'employment', 'use', 'countryside', 'scale', 'appropriate', 'location', 'override', 'locational', 'business', 'need', 'location', 'extension', 'exist', 'business', 'relocation', 'impractical', 'viable', 'support', 'demand', 'countryside', 'location', 'advise', 'decisions', 'enable', 'sustainable', 'growth', 'expansion', 'type', 'business', 'rural', 'conversion', 'exist', 'welldesigned', 'applicant', 'business', 'need', 'rural', 'location', 'scale', 'internal', 'layout', 'design', 'distinctive', 'relate', 'spatially', 'exist', 'prominent', 'discordant', 'feature', 'scene', 'conserve', 'enhance', 'character', 'wider', 'open', 'countryside', 'fail', 'accord', 'abovementioned', 'insufficient', 'evidence', 'regard', 'surface', 'water', 'disposal', 'drainage', 'adequately', 'achieve', 'increase', 'flood', 'risk', 'absence']",0.07298697531223297,,0.16350966691970825,,0.06748446822166443,,,0.13620193302631378,,,,
912,1014,PA21/07810,Construction of residential dwelling,06/10/2021," 1 The site and the surrounding area has experienced a number of historic flood events due to problems associated with the restricted capacity of the culverted sections of the Paul Stream and its tributaries. These are liable to blockage and have not been considered in the submitted Flood Risk Assessment. The submitted Flood Risk Assessment has failed to consider the safe access and egress to site during a flood event or to determine the hazard rating. This is required to make a decision on whether the level of risk during a flood event is acceptable in terms of emergency access and egress for the occupants. The Flood Risk Assessment is inadequate and fails to demonstrate that safe access and egress to the site during a flood event can be achieved in conflict with Policy 26 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraph 167 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The proposed dwelling is not reflective of the surrounding development and would appear at odds with the established character of the Mousehole Conservation Area. The proposed development would result in the gradual erosion of the sense of place which is created through locally distinctive buildings in conflict with Policy 2 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 which sets out that development should be high quality and demonstrate a cultural, physical and aesthetic understanding of its location.

The proposal is therefore considered to fail to ensure the delivery of a high quality, comprehensive new neighbourhood, in conflict with the aims and intentions of Policy H-UE1 of the Cornwall Site Allocations Development Plan Document and the Hayle Growth Area - Concept Plan. 2 In the absence of a geophysical survey which is required owing to the existence of a number of known heritage assets nearby, the proposal is considered to conflict with the aims and intentions of Policy 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 189 and 194 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 3 In the absence of a suitable mechanism to secure mitigation for the effects of the development - related specifically to affordable housing, transportation, green infrastructure, open space, employment land, education and healthcare - the proposal is considered to conflict with the aims and intentions of policies 8, 13 and 28 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030; Policy H-UE1 of the Cornwall Site Allocations Development Plan Document; and the Hayle Growth Area - Concept Plan.",Smallscale Major Dwellings,,Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,PA20/11368,,"['exclude', 'strip', 'southwest', 'boundary', 'outline', 'blue', 'submit', 'draw', 'show', 'indicatively', 'hayle', 'growth', 'concept', 'main', 'serve', 'immediate', 'wider', 'growth', 'wide', 'accommodate', 'main', 'necessary', 'infrastructure', 'doubt', 'accommodate', 'connect', 'successfully', 'highway', 'infrastructure', 'north', 'location', 'highly', 'likely', 'ined', 'adjacent', 'north', 'fail', 'ensure', 'delivery', 'high', 'quality', 'comprehensive', 'neighbourhood', 'allocations', 'document', 'hayle', 'growth', 'concept', 'absence', 'geophysical', 'survey', 'require', 'owe', 'existence', 'number', 'know', 'heritage', 'assets', 'nearby', 'absence', 'suitable', 'mechanism', 'secure', 'mitigation', 'effect', 'relate', 'specifically', 'affordable', 'transportation', 'green', 'infrastructure', 'open', 'space', 'employment', 'land', 'education', 'healthcare', 'allocations', 'document', 'hayle', 'growth', 'concept']","['exclude', 'strip', 'southwest', 'boundary', 'outline', 'blue', 'submit', 'draw', 'show', 'indicatively', 'hayle', 'growth', 'concept', 'main', 'serve', 'immediate', 'wider', 'growth', 'wide', 'accommodate', 'main', 'necessary', 'infrastructure', 'doubt', 'accommodate', 'connect', 'successfully', 'highway', 'infrastructure', 'north', 'location', 'highly', 'likely', 'ined', 'adjacent', 'north', 'fail', 'ensure', 'delivery', 'high', 'quality', 'comprehensive', 'neighbourhood', 'allocations', 'document', 'hayle', 'growth', 'concept', 'absence', 'geophysical', 'survey', 'require', 'owe', 'existence', 'number', 'know', 'heritage', 'assets', 'nearby', 'absence', 'suitable', 'mechanism', 'secure', 'mitigation', 'effect', 'relate', 'specifically', 'affordable', 'transportation', 'green', 'infrastructure', 'open', 'space', 'employment', 'land', 'education', 'healthcare', 'allocations', 'document', 'hayle', 'growth', 'concept']",,,,,,0.2371327430009842,,,,,0.04133499413728714,0.2929714024066925

It is not considered that the need and benefits of the development clearly outweigh this harm. In addition, notwithstanding the submitted DEFRA Metric 3.0 computation and its inclusion of a nearby biodiversity offsetting area, the proposal fails to properly account for the loss of the wet woodland/marshy grassland priority habitat on site. Furthermore, it fails to deploy the mitigation hierarchy as required, and to specify an acceptable offsetting mechanism. As such, the proposal conflicts with Policies 1, 2, 5.3, 23(3)(c) and 23(4) of the Cornwall Local Plan 2016; Policies EM6 and GRN1 of the emergent Saltash Neighbourhood Plan; Policy G2 of the emergent Cornwall Climate Emergency Development Plan Document (Submission Version); and paragraph 174(d) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The proposal, through the stationing of 20 holiday lodges with associated landscape works within this wild, marshy, wet-woodland section of the Tamar Valley AONB would fail to conserve and enhance the natural beauty of the landscape. As such the proposal conflicts with Policies 1, 2.1 and 23.2 (a) of the Cornwall Local Plan 2016 and paragraphs 176 and 177 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. There are not considered to be exceptional circumstances that override this harm. 3 In seeking to locate a more vulnerable development within Flood Zone 3b, i.e., the functional floodplain, the proposal poses an unacceptable risk to life and property from flooding in a manner that would not be resilient to climate change. This harm conflicts with Policies 2(2)b and 26 of the Cornwall Local Plan 2016, emergent Saltash Neighbourhood Development Plan Policy GRN4.2 (i) and (ii) and paragraphs 159 and 162 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 4 It has not been demonstrated that the existing on-site package foul drainage plant has adequate capacity to deal with the increased flows that would result from the development.  The resulting risk of contamination to the natural environment conflicts with Policies 13.5 and 16.1 of the Cornwall Local Plan 2016, emergent Saltash Neighbourhood Development Plan Policy GRN4.2(iii)  and paragraphs 174(e) and 185 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",All other small scale major developments,"Saltash Neighbourhood Plan,Saltash Neighbourhood Development Plan",Cornwall Local Plan,,AONB,"['associate', 'change', 'landscape', 'turn', 'exist', 'habitats', 'species', 'harm', 'feature', 'function', 'notter', 'bridge', 'county', 'wildlife', 'wider', 'ecological', 'need', 'clearly', 'outweigh', 'harm', 'addition', 'notwithstanding', 'submit', 'defra', 'metric', 'computation', 'inclusion', 'nearby', 'biodivery', 'offset', 'fail', 'properly', 'account', 'loss', 'woodlandmarshy', 'grasspriority', 'habitat', 'furthermore', 'fail', 'deploy', 'mitigation', 'hierarchy', 'require', 'specify', 'acceptable', 'offset', 'mechanism', 'emergent', 'emergent', 'climate', 'emergency', 'document', 'submission', 'version', 'station', 'holiday', 'lodge', 'associate', 'landscape', 'wild', 'marshy', 'wetwood', 'tamar', 'valley', 'aonb', 'fail', 'conserve', 'enhance', 'natural', 'beauty', 'landscape', 'exceptional', 'override', 'harm', 'seek', 'locate', 'vulnerable', 'flood', 'zone', 'functional', 'floodplain', 'pose', 'unacceptable', 'risk', 'life', 'property', 'flood', 'manner', 'resilient', 'climate', 'change', 'harm', 'emergent', 'exist', 'package', 'foul', 'drainage', 'adequate', 'capacity', 'deal', 'increase', 'flow', 'risk', 'contamination', 'natural', 'environment', 'emergent', 'grniii']","['associate', 'change', 'landscape', 'turn', 'exist', 'habitats', 'species', 'harm', 'feature', 'function', 'notter', 'bridge', 'county', 'wildlife', 'wider', 'ecological', 'need', 'clearly', 'outweigh', 'harm', 'addition', 'notwithstanding', 'submit', 'defra', 'metric', 'computation', 'inclusion', 'nearby', 'biodivery', 'offset', 'fail', 'properly', 'account', 'loss', 'woodlandmarshy', 'grasspriority', 'habitat', 'furthermore', 'fail', 'deploy', 'mitigation', 'hierarchy', 'require', 'specify', 'acceptable', 'offset', 'mechanism', 'emergent', 'emergent', 'climate', 'emergency', 'document', 'submission', 'version', 'station', 'holiday', 'lodge', 'associate', 'landscape', 'wild', 'marshy', 'wetwood', 'tamar', 'valley', 'aonb', 'fail', 'conserve', 'enhance', 'natural', 'beauty', 'landscape', 'exceptional', 'override', 'harm', 'seek', 'locate', 'vulnerable', 'flood', 'zone', 'functional', 'floodplain', 'pose', 'unacceptable', 'risk', 'life', 'property', 'flood', 'manner', 'resilient', 'climate', 'change', 'harm', 'emergent', 'exist', 'package', 'foul', 'drainage', 'adequate', 'capacity', 'deal', 'increase', 'flow', 'risk', 'contamination', 'natural', 'environment', 'emergent', 'grniii']",,,,0.7227662205696106,,,,0.26897531747817993,,,,

It has not been demonstrated that the adverse impacts are unavoidable as alternatives to the loss of priority habitat have not been adequately explored. Nor has it been demonstrated that the proposed lake excavation and water abstraction will not adversely affect the hydrology of the adjacent Rock Dunes Site of Special Scientific Interest and priority habitat within the County Wildlife Site. The Phase 1 Habitat Survey identified the need for further reptile survey work which has not been submitted. Nor has the application been accompanied by the necessary invertebrate and botanical surveys undertaken in the appropriate May to October period. In the absence of the necessary survey work, there is insufficient evidence to assess the likely impact on the species and its supporting habitat.

The proposal does not accord with the aims and intentions of Policies 1 and 3 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030, or any of the special circumstances outlined in Policy 7 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030. The building is visible from the public highway. It is sited in a sporadic location in relation to the existing development and represents an encroachment of built form into the undeveloped countryside. The presence of the building on the site with its associated domestic paraphernalia give rises to intrinsic harm to the character and beauty of the countryside. This would be at odds with the aims and intentions of Policies 1, 2 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 8 and 174 of the NPPF (2021) which seek to protect the character and beauty of the countryside. Although there is a bus stop on the highway which adjoins the access lane the road is unlit and there is no pedestrian footway. The road is narrow and winding in places with no pedestrian footways and consequently is not an attractive alternative to the private vehicle.

949,1054,PA22/03336,Variation of Condition 2 (approved plans) and removal of Condition 11 of Application No. PA20/03591 dated 2nd December 2020 (Construction of two dwellings and associated gardens and access road),05/04/2022," 1 The proposed revision to condition 2 and removal of condition 11 of permission PA20/03591 dated 2nd December 2020 would alter the nature of the development in a manner that would differ materially from the approved permission. As a result this proposal goes beyond the scope of Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and is contrary to guidance within the National Planning Practice Guidance, specifically paragraphs 001 Reference ID: 17a-001-20140306 (Revision date: 06 03 2014) and 031 Reference ID: 21a-031-20180615 (Revision date: 15 06 2018). 2 The amended development proposed by this application to vary condition 2 and remove condition 11 of permission PA20/03591 dated 2nd December 2020 would result in an increase in the amount of vehicular traffic accessing and egressing to and from the site over the U6168/C68 priority T-junction which based on observed road speeds is substandard due to its limited emerging visibility for drivers exiting the junction and limited forward visibility for drivers approaching the junction from the south, which would contribute to an increased risk of collision and reduction in highway safety to both occupants and members of the public. The proposed application therefore, fails to provide safe and suitable access compared with the access arrangement approved and secured by condition 10 of permission PA20/03591, the proposed amended access arrangement is considered to materially diminish the quality of permission PA20/03591 by virtue of the reduced visibility splays at the proposed site access and the increased loss of hedgerow that will occur to provide visibility improvement and splays that will be detrimental to the character and appearance of the streetscene. The application and is contrary to Policies 1, 2, 12, 23 and 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 (adopted November 2016) and paragraphs 104 - 112, 130, 131 and 135 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 3 In the absence of appropriate evidence, the proposal fails to adequately demonstrate how the proposed works to the existing hedgerows to create visibility splays would impact upon any species protected by law both during and post implementation of the proposed scheme, existing trees in or adjacent to hedgerow works. In the absence of such information the Local Planning Authority is unable to assess whether adverse harm would be generated with respect to any protected species or existing trees. Hence the development is contrary to the aims of paragraphs 179-180 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, guidance within the section titled 'Natural environment' of Planning Practice Guidance, together with Policies 1, 2, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030.",Minor - Dwelling,,Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,PA20/03591,,"['revision', 'removal', 'date', 'alter', 'nature', 'manner', 'differ', 'materially', 'approve', 'go', 'scope', 'country', 'practice', 'specifically', 'reference', 'revision', 'date', 'reference', 'revision', 'date', 'amend', 'vary', 'remove', 'date', 'increase', 'vehicular', 'traffic', 'access', 'egress', 'priority', 'tjunction', 'base', 'observe', 'road', 'speed', 'substandard', 'limit', 'emerge', 'visibility', 'drivers', 'exit', 'junction', 'limit', 'forward', 'visibility', 'drivers', 'approach', 'junction', 'south', 'contribute', 'increase', 'risk', 'collision', 'reduction', 'highway', 'safety', 'occupants', 'members', 'public', 'fail', 'safe', 'suitable', 'access', 'compare', 'access', 'arrangement', 'approve', 'secure', 'amend', 'access', 'arrangement', 'materially', 'diminish', 'quality', 'virtue', 'reduce', 'visibility', 'splay', 'access', 'increase', 'loss', 'hedgerow', 'occur', 'visibility', 'improvement', 'splay', 'detrimental', 'character', 'appearance', 'stscene', 'absence', 'appropriate', 'evidence', 'fail', 'adequately', 'exist', 'hedgerows', 'create', 'visibility', 'splay', 'species', 'protect', 'post', 'implementation', 'scheme', 'exist', 'adjacent', 'hedgerow', 'absence', 'authority', 'unable', 'assess', 'adverse', 'harm', 'generate', 'respect', 'protect', 'species', 'exist', 'title', 'natural', 'environment', 'practice']","['revision', 'removal', 'date', 'alter', 'nature', 'manner', 'differ', 'materially', 'approve', 'go', 'scope', 'country', 'practice', 'specifically', 'reference', 'revision', 'date', 'reference', 'revision', 'date', 'amend', 'vary', 'remove', 'date', 'increase', 'vehicular', 'traffic', 'access', 'egress', 'priority', 'tjunction', 'base', 'observe', 'road', 'speed', 'substandard', 'limit', 'emerge', 'visibility', 'drivers', 'exit', 'junction', 'limit', 'forward', 'visibility', 'drivers', 'approach', 'junction', 'south', 'contribute', 'increase', 'risk', 'collision', 'reduction', 'highway', 'safety', 'occupants', 'members', 'public', 'fail', 'safe', 'suitable', 'access', 'compare', 'access', 'arrangement', 'approve', 'secure', 'amend', 'access', 'arrangement', 'materially', 'diminish', 'quality', 'virtue', 'reduce', 'visibility', 'splay', 'access', 'increase', 'loss', 'hedgerow', 'occur', 'visibility', 'improvement', 'splay', 'detrimental', 'character', 'appearance', 'stscene', 'absence', 'appropriate', 'evidence', 'fail', 'adequately', 'exist', 'hedgerows', 'create', 'visibility', 'splay', 'species', 'protect', 'post', 'implementation', 'scheme', 'exist', 'adjacent', 'hedgerow', 'absence', 'authority', 'unable', 'assess', 'adverse', 'harm', 'generate', 'respect', 'protect', 'species', 'exist', 'title', 'natural', 'environment', 'practice']",,,,0.13517117500305176,0.0786278024315834,0.5267568826675415,,,,,0.018451254814863205,
950,1055,PA22/03322,Conversion of redundant block-built workshop to form residential dwelling.,04/04/2022," 1 By reason of the utilitarian form of the existing building, which does not warrant retention, together with the works associated with the development which result in the domestification of the site, the proposed development would alter and harmfully urbanise the strong rural characteristics of this section of the open countryside. As such, the proposed development fails to lead to an enhancement to the immediate setting and is therefore unjustified by any special circumstances. The proposed development is considered to give rise to a sporadic and unsustainable form of residential development within the open countryside, in conflict with the aims and intentions of policies 1, 2, 7, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 8, 130 and 174 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The proposed development is accessed via a short section of unclassified highway which adjoins a Class C highway at either end. The necessary vehicular access to the site is extremely constrained due to the lack of visibility of oncoming traffic when egressing onto the Class C highway.

It is considered that the proposed development would be harmful to the landscape character and natural beauty of the AONB in this highly sensitive and prominent location, by reason of its increased scale and mass when compared to the existing situation, which would result in a more conspicuous development, particularly in views from the south and south east.

Accordingly, the proposed extension would read as an incongruous, tacked-on feature that would fail to respect the modest form and character of the rural building and would appear as a prominent addition, and thus it would change so much that its existing character would have less relevance and the altered main building would be subservient to the extension.

The subject building is considered to be a traditional vernacular building and worthy of retention. The addition of an incongruous, tacked-on feature is unsympathetic to the local character and history of the surrounding rural environment.For these reasons the proposal conflicts with Policy 7 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 along with paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 3 In the absence of a mechanism to secure the provision of financial contributions to mitigate the recreation impact on the Fal and Helford Special Area of Conservation for which there is evidence of an identified need, the proposal is considered to be contrary to policies 22 of the Cornwall Local Plan.",Minor - Dwelling,,Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,,,"['combination', 'scale', 'construction', 'effect', 'storey', 'addition', 'dominate', 'main', 'exist', 'farm', 'accordingly', 'extension', 'read', 'incongruous', 'tackedon', 'feature', 'fail', 'respect', 'modest', 'character', 'rural', 'appear', 'prominent', 'addition', 'change', 'exist', 'character', 'relevance', 'alter', 'main', 'subservient', 'extension', 'harm', 'character', 'appearance', 'modest', 'traditional', 'rural', 'para', 'support', 'text', 'refer', 'traditional', 'vernacular', 'define', 'character', 'cornish', 'countryside', 'subject', 'traditional', 'vernacular', 'worthy', 'retention', 'addition', 'incongruous', 'tackedon', 'feature', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'history', 'surround', 'rural', 'environmentfor', 'absence', 'mechanism', 'secure', 'provision', 'financial', 'contributions', 'mitigate', 'recreation', 'helford', 'special', 'conservation', 'evidence', 'identify', 'need']","['combination', 'scale', 'construction', 'effect', 'storey', 'addition', 'dominate', 'main', 'exist', 'farm', 'accordingly', 'extension', 'read', 'incongruous', 'tackedon', 'feature', 'fail', 'respect', 'modest', 'character', 'rural', 'appear', 'prominent', 'addition', 'change', 'exist', 'character', 'relevance', 'alter', 'main', 'subservient', 'extension', 'harm', 'character', 'appearance', 'modest', 'traditional', 'rural', 'para', 'support', 'text', 'refer', 'traditional', 'vernacular', 'define', 'character', 'cornish', 'countryside', 'subject', 'traditional', 'vernacular', 'worthy', 'retention', 'addition', 'incongruous', 'tackedon', 'feature', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'history', 'surround', 'rural', 'environmentfor', 'absence', 'mechanism', 'secure', 'provision', 'financial', 'contributions', 'mitigate', 'recreation', 'helford', 'special', 'conservation', 'evidence', 'identify', 'need']",,,0.5561904907226562,,0.06246428191661835,,,,,,,0.25744301080703735

No compelling evidence has been provided that these activities would be impractical to or could not viably be relocated. Accordingly, the proposal is considered to conflict with the spatial strategy of the development plan through conflict with Policies 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030. 2 The site is in an area subject to the highest risk of flooding. It has not been demonstrated that the development is 'necessary' on this particular site (neither operationally, nor in respect to the viability of relocating to an area of lower flood risk), nor, in the absence of a suitable Flood Risk Assessment, has it been demonstrated that it would be safe for its lifetime without increasing flood risk elsewhere. Accordingly, the proposal conflicts with Policies 2(2.b.), 12(1.d.) and 26 (2.a-d) of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraphs 159, 161, 162, 167 of the National Planning Policy Framework. 3 The proposal would increase vehicle movements using a junction that by reason of its substandard visibility and narrowness of approach lane would be unsuitable to accommodate such additional movements without prejudicing highway safety conditions. Accordingly, the proposal conflicts with Policy 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraphs 110, 111 and 112 of the National Planning Policy Framework. 4 The proposal would result in the retention of a significant number of wooden structures, hardstandings, and other structures and artefacts spread over the two parts of the site which creates visual clutter that distracts and detracts from the natural beauty of the area. These are visible from public realm and are of a scale, extent and appearance that are incongruous and cause harm to the verdant natural beauty of this designated Area of Great Landscape Value.

The dwelling, of the design, scale, proportions and finish proposed, would fail to respond positively to the historic local character and distinctiveness in this location, appearing as a discordant feature, out of context within its immediate context; it would attract much greater attention than the existing store, thereby further reducing the primacy of the former host and adjacent dwellings and harmfully contributing to the disruption and erosion of the established hierarchy, which forms an integral part of the morphology of the historic settlement. Unjustified by any overriding public benefits, the proposed development would adversely impact upon the character and appearance of the streetscene and result in less than substantial harm to the OUV of the WHS, in conflict with the aims and intentions of policies 1, 2, 12 and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030, paragraphs 8, 130, 189, 197, 199 and 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policies P3, C2 and C9 of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site Management Plan 2020 - 2025 and the guidance within the Cornwall Design Guide 2021. 2 The proposed development, by reason of its scale, design and mass, together with its proximity to and relationship with the gardens serving neighbouring dwellings adjoining the site, would have an overbearing impact upon the said gardens, leading to an adverse sense of enclosure that would result in harm to residential amenity, in conflict with the aims and intentions of policies 1, 12 and 13 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 3 In the absence of sufficient technical information to support the application, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed scheme for the disposal of surface water drainage is achievable so as to successfully minimise, reduce or where possible eliminate flood risk on site and in the area and avoid an increased risk of flooding elsewhere.

The proposed dwelling therefore represents unjustified and sporadic development within the open countryside with poor accessibility to necessary daily services and facilities which would perpetuate over reliance on the private vehicle and unsustainable traffic movements.  The proposed new dwelling, in combination with the inevitable introduction of additional domestic paraphernalia associated with an additional dwelling, in this context of the rural setting, would result in harm to the distinctive landscape character of the area and would appear incongruous within the countryside.

1055,1170,PA22/06065,Construction of Two Storey Extension and Associated Works,30/06/2022," 1 By virtue of the scale and design, the proposed extension is an inappropriate, discordant and overly-dominant addition to a traditional cottage that currently remains relatively unaltered and unobtrusive in the context of the surrounding historic built environment. The proposed works materially reduce the visual quality of an iconic streetscape, and fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Penzance Conservation Area; the contribution of the host building that is afforded Group Value; and the setting of the adjacent Grade II listed building(s). The National Planning Policy Framework requires harm to be weighed against the public benefit of the proposals. In this case the harm of the proposed two storey extension has been set out above.  Although the private benefits and minor economic benefits of the extension are appreciated, the proposed works would result in less than substantial harm in relation to the Conservation Area and its setting that are not balanced by these factors or other factors acting in the public interest.The proposal is therefore contrary to the aims and intentions of Policies 1, 2 (paragraphs 1a to 1d), 12 (paragraphs 1a and 1b) and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 (Adopted 22nd November 2016); Sections 2 (paragraph 2.1.1), 3 (paragraphs 3.1.2, 3.2.2 and 3.3.5) and 5 (paragraph 5.8.1) of the Cornwall Design Guide 2021; and paragraphs 126, 130 (paragraphs a to d), 132, 134, 189, 197(c), 199, 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. The proposed development does not accord with the local planning authority's statutory duty under section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 because it would not preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. 2 The proposed extension, due to its design, scale and location, results in a harmful increase in overbearing, loss of light and loss of outlook in relation to the first floor terrace and living room window of the immediately adjacent neighbouring property to the northwest (23 New St / Abbey Cottage)The proposed two storey rear extension would result in a loss of outlook and loss of light in relation to the living room window, and would further result in harmful overbearing, loss of outlook and loss of sunlight/ambient light to the existing terrace. The proposed works have a detrimental impact upon the main living area and associated terrace of 23 New St / Abbey Cottage, that are currently enjoyed by users of these properties.The proposed extension would raise concerns relating to the impact upon users of the neighbouring property that are not balanced by other factors acting in the public interest.The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 12 (paragraph 2b) of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 (Adopted 22nd November 2016); Section 9 of the Cornwall Design Guide 2021; and paragraphs 126, 130 and 132 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021",Householder,,Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,,,"['virtue', 'scale', 'design', 'extension', 'inappropriate', 'discordant', 'overlydominant', 'addition', 'traditional', 'cottage', 'currently', 'remain', 'relatively', 'unaltered', 'unobtrusive', 'context', 'surround', 'historic', 'environment', 'materially', 'reduce', 'visual', 'quality', 'iconic', 'stscape', 'fail', 'preserve', 'character', 'appearance', 'penzance', 'conservation', 'contribution', 'host', 'afford', 'group', 'value', 'set', 'adjacent', 'grade', 'list', 'require', 'harm', 'weigh', 'public', 'case', 'harm', 'storey', 'extension', 'private', 'minor', 'economic', 'extension', 'appreciate', 'substantial', 'harm', 'relation', 'conservation', 'set', 'act', 'public', 'interestthe', 'design', 'guide', 'accord', 'authoritys', 'statutory', 'duty', 'list', 'conservation', 'preserve', 'enhance', 'character', 'appearance', 'conservation', 'extension', 'design', 'scale', 'location', 'harmful', 'increase', 'overbear', 'loss', 'light', 'loss', 'outlook', 'relation', 'floor', 'terrace', 'live', 'room', 'window', 'immediately', 'adjacent', 'neighbour', 'property', 'northwest', 'abbey', 'cottagethe', 'storey', 'rear', 'extension', 'loss', 'outlook', 'loss', 'light', 'relation', 'live', 'room', 'window', 'harmful', 'overbear', 'loss', 'outlook', 'loss', 'sunlightambient', 'light', 'exist', 'terrace', 'detrimental', 'main', 'live', 'associate', 'terrace', 'abbey', 'cottage', 'currently', 'enjoy', 'users', 'propertiesthe', 'extension', 'concern', 'relate', 'users', 'neighbour', 'property', 'act', 'public', 'interestthe', 'design', 'guide']","['virtue', 'scale', 'design', 'extension', 'inappropriate', 'discordant', 'overlydominant', 'addition', 'traditional', 'cottage', 'currently', 'remain', 'relatively', 'unaltered', 'unobtrusive', 'context', 'surround', 'historic', 'environment', 'materially', 'reduce', 'visual', 'quality', 'iconic', 'stscape', 'fail', 'preserve', 'character', 'appearance', 'penzance', 'conservation', 'contribution', 'host', 'afford', 'group', 'value', 'set', 'adjacent', 'grade', 'list', 'require', 'harm', 'weigh', 'public', 'case', 'harm', 'storey', 'extension', 'private', 'minor', 'economic', 'extension', 'appreciate', 'substantial', 'harm', 'relation', 'conservation', 'set', 'act', 'public', 'interestthe', 'design', 'guide', 'accord', 'authoritys', 'statutory', 'duty', 'list', 'conservation', 'preserve', 'enhance', 'character', 'appearance', 'conservation', 'extension', 'design', 'scale', 'location', 'harmful', 'increase', 'overbear', 'loss', 'light', 'loss', 'outlook', 'relation', 'floor', 'terrace', 'live', 'room', 'window', 'immediately', 'adjacent', 'neighbour', 'property', 'northwest', 'abbey', 'cottagethe', 'storey', 'rear', 'extension', 'loss', 'outlook', 'loss', 'light', 'relation', 'live', 'room', 'window', 'harmful', 'overbear', 'loss', 'outlook', 'loss', 'sunlightambient', 'light', 'exist', 'terrace', 'detrimental', 'main', 'live', 'associate', 'terrace', 'abbey', 'cottage', 'currently', 'enjoy', 'users', 'propertiesthe', 'extension', 'concern', 'relate', 'users', 'neighbour', 'property', 'act', 'public', 'interestthe', 'design', 'guide']",,0.43038100004196167,,,,,,,0.38791877031326294,,,

It would represent housing development in the open countryside which would not relate well to an existing settlement, would be in an unsustainable location and would harm the character of the open countryside. The proposal would not represent infill or rounding off, or a rural exceptions development, does not fall within the special circumstances listed within policy 7 of the Cornwall Local Plan, and would increase building density which would be out of character with the surrounding area and divorced from services and facilities.

The proposed development conflicts with the aims and intentions set out within Policies AD2, AD4 and AD8 of the St Just-in-Penwith Parish Neighbourhood Plan 2021-2030, Policies 1, 2, 12, 23 and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, paragraphs 8, 130, 174, 176 and Section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies PD-P1, PD-P2 and PD-P11 of the Cornwall AONB Management Plan 2022-2027 and Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. 2 In the absence of an ecological survey to identify the presence and impact on protected species, the Local Planning Authority are unable to assess whether the development would adversely impact on biodiversity and the ecological value of the site, with specific regard to protected species.

1062,1179,PA22/05524,Demolition and replacement of existing front and rear extensions.,30/06/2022," 1 The extensions by reason of their design, finish, scale and bulk would significantly detract from the architectural merits of the original dwelling, rendering the architectural merits of the original building largely undetectable. The extensions would dominate the building thereby resulting in the loss of the original character and form of the dwelling which as present contributes to the character and appearance of the area. In addition, with regard to the narrow plot character of the existing terrace, the scale of the extensions represent development which appears cramped and contrived failing to demonstrate a cultural, physical and aesthetic understanding of its location. The proposed development would harm the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and surrounding area and the small economic gain through the construction of the extensions is not considered a benefit that outweighs the identified harm with particular regard to Policy 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraph 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. The proposed development fails to conserve and enhance the landscape character and natural beauty of the AONB, maintain the character and distinctive landscape qualities of the Heritage Coast, preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the St Just Conservation Area and protect and conserve the significance of the St Just Mining District World Heritage Site in conflict with the aims and intentions set out within Policies AD2 and AD4 of the St Just-in-Penwith Neighbourhood Development Plan 2021-2030, Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Policies 1, 2, 12, 23 and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, paragraphs 8, 130, 174, 176 and Section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and policies PD-P1, PD-P2 and PD-P11 of the Cornwall AONB Management Plan 2022-2027.  2 The extension on the east elevation protrudes from the rear to an extent which results in overbearing impacts on the neighbouring properties known as 49 and 51 Carn Bosavern. In addition, due to the pattern of the sun, the extension is considered to result in overshadowing impacts on the neighbouring property known as 49 Carn Bosavern. The extension is considered to cause significant and demonstrable harm to the living conditions of the occupiers of the neighbouring dwellings known as 49 and 51 Carn Bosavern with particular regard to overbearing and overshadowing in conflict with the aims and intentions set out within Policies 1 and 12 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraphs 8 and 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 3 In the absence of an ecological survey to identify the presence and impact on protected species, the Local Planning Authority are unable to assess whether the development would adversely impact on biodiversity and the ecological value of the site, with specific regard to protected species.

The scheme represents an undesirable encroachment and intrusion of the built form into the open, historic countryside setting to the detriment of the character and appearance of the countryside and setting of the World Heritage Site. The proposal would therefore fail to preserve the character and special interest of the World Heritage Site, leading to harm which would not be outweighed by significant public benefit. In the absence of any special circumstances to justify residential development in this context, the proposal represents unjustified development and would be contrary to policies 2, 3, 7, 12, 21, 23 and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030, section 7.1 of the The Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site Management Plan 2020-2025 and paragraphs 120, 130, 134, 194, 195, 197 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 2 In the absence of adequate ecological survey, the application fails to demonstrate that the proposal would conserve and enhance habitat and biodiversity.

Additionally, the flat roof proposed in order to accommodate the parking space is considered to be an incongruous addition that would appear out of keeping with the surrounding area which is predominantly comprised of pitched tiled roofs. The development is therefore considered to be contrary to the aims and intensions of Policies SD5 of the Hayle Neighbourhood Development Plan, Policies 1, 2 and 12 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030, the Cornwall Design Guide 2021 and paragraphs 130 and 134 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The proposals result in an overbearing and intrusive form of development having an adverse effect by overshadowing and loss of outlook on neighbouring properties and resulting in poor standards of residential amenity.The height and form of proposed outbuilding, together with its massing and position directly adjacent to 10 Back Lane's northwestern boundary, is considered to create a strong sense of enclosure experienced by the occupants of 10 Back Lane. It is considered that the outbuilding would significantly reduce the levels of residential amenity enjoyed by the occupants of 10 Back Lane, with the outlook from both the garden and northeast facing ground floor habitable rooms severely impacted and resulting in unacceptable overbearing impacts. The scheme conflicts with Policy 12 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 which seek, amongst other matters, to ensure new development does not adversely affect the amenity of neighbouring properties. 3 In the absence of relevant assessments or detailed drawings, it is considered that none of the submitted written material is sufficient to demonstrate that the necessary site works would not cause an unacceptable risk to the retaining wall supporting the public highway. The National Planning Policy Framework in paragraph 174 makes it clear that new development will be expected, as a matter of national planning policy, not to put existing development at unacceptable risk from, nor adversely to affect it by, land instability. There is also insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the proposed outbuilding would be adequately supported to allow vehicles to park on the roof. In these circumstances the conclusion is that the proposal as submitted would be likely to result in material harm to the stability of land both on and in the immediate vicinity of the site, and in particular in relation to the retaining wall supporting the public highway.

The appearance of any new development on the site would be seen as a harmful encroachment into the surrounding countryside, to which it has a greater affinity than the adjoining urban form, and would result in a loss of its distinctive rural landscape character, which is subject to special protection through its designation within Camborne and Redruth Mining District World Heritage Site (WHS). Unjustified by any overriding public benefits, this sporadic form of new residential development would result in the loss of part of the relic landscape, which contributes positively to the Outstanding Universal Value and the significance of the WHS. Further environmental harm would result through the lack of suitable pedestrian infrastructure between the site and the nearest settlement, thereby giving rise to a likely increase in the reliance on the private motor vehicle, and hence unsustainable transport movements.

The proposed development, by reason of the location, proximity and height of each dwelling, would appear as a discordant feature within the undeveloped rural fringe of the settlement and would cause significant and demonstrable harm to the living conditions of the occupiers of the identified neighbouring dwellings thereby failing to demonstrate a cultural, physical and aesthetic understanding of its location and gives rise to overlooking and overbearing impacts upon the residential amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties in conflict with the aims and intentions set out within Policies 1, 2 and 12 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraphs 8 and 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 3 In the absence of a mechanism to adequately secure the provision of a financial contribution towards mitigating recreational impacts upon the Penhale Dunes Special Area of Conservation, the proposal is contrary to Policy 22 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030, and the aims and intentions of paragraphs 55, 174 and 180 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",Minor - Dwelling,St Agnes Neighbourhood Development Plan 2018-2030,Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,,,"['locate', 'outside', 'definable', 'limit', 'porthtowan', 'acceptable', 'infill', 'round', 'define', 'previously', 'develop', 'land', 'undesirable', 'sporadic', 'extension', 'adjoin', 'countryside', 'lead', 'visual', 'harm', 'erosion', 'landscape', 'character', 'heritage', 'coast', 'senive', 'visually', 'prominent', 'edge', 'village', 'porthtowan', 'absence', 'special', 'residential', 'context', 'sustainable', 'topography', 'combine', 'mass', 'location', 'proximity', 'neighbour', 'south', 'overly', 'dominant', 'create', 'oppressive', 'sense', 'enclosure', 'unacceptable', 'level', 'overlook', 'fenestration', 'project', 'floor', 'balconyterraces', 'relation', 'frontage', 'windows', 'external', 'amenity', 'exist', 'neighbour', 'south', 'know', 'towan', 'pensilva', 'location', 'proximity', 'height', 'appear', 'discordant', 'feature', 'undeveloped', 'rural', 'fringe', 'cause', 'significant', 'demonstrable', 'harm', 'live', 'occupiers', 'identify', 'neighbour', 'fail', 'cultural', 'physical', 'aesthetic', 'understand', 'location', 'give', 'rise', 'overlook', 'overbear', 'residential', 'amenities', 'occupiers', 'neighbour', 'properties', 'absence', 'mechanism', 'adequately', 'secure', 'provision', 'financial', 'contribution', 'mitigate', 'recreational', 'penhale', 'dun', 'special', 'conservation']","['locate', 'outside', 'definable', 'limit', 'porthtowan', 'acceptable', 'infill', 'round', 'define', 'previously', 'develop', 'land', 'undesirable', 'sporadic', 'extension', 'adjoin', 'countryside', 'lead', 'visual', 'harm', 'erosion', 'landscape', 'character', 'heritage', 'coast', 'senive', 'visually', 'prominent', 'edge', 'village', 'porthtowan', 'absence', 'special', 'residential', 'context', 'sustainable', 'topography', 'combine', 'mass', 'location', 'proximity', 'neighbour', 'south', 'overly', 'dominant', 'create', 'oppressive', 'sense', 'enclosure', 'unacceptable', 'level', 'overlook', 'fenestration', 'project', 'floor', 'balconyterraces', 'relation', 'frontage', 'windows', 'external', 'amenity', 'exist', 'neighbour', 'south', 'know', 'towan', 'pensilva', 'location', 'proximity', 'height', 'appear', 'discordant', 'feature', 'undeveloped', 'rural', 'fringe', 'cause', 'significant', 'demonstrable', 'harm', 'live', 'occupiers', 'identify', 'neighbour', 'fail', 'cultural', 'physical', 'aesthetic', 'understand', 'location', 'give', 'rise', 'overlook', 'overbear', 'residential', 'amenities', 'occupiers', 'neighbour', 'properties', 'absence', 'mechanism', 'adequately', 'secure', 'provision', 'financial', 'contribution', 'mitigate', 'recreational', 'penhale', 'dun', 'special', 'conservation']",,0.19983845949172974,0.23090872168540955,,,,,,0.06342265009880066,,,0.07551788538694382

The public benefits of the scheme are limited in providing one new dwelling to the local housing stock but this does not outweigh the identified harm. As such it would be contrary to Policy 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 which indicates that development within the WHS should accord with the Management Plan and that proposals that would result in harm to the authenticity and integrity of the Outstanding Universal Value should be wholly exceptional.

Furthermore, the proposed design and introduction of a residential use on the site would not lead to an enhancement of the immediate setting, where the proposed increase in the height and massing of the building would introduce an incongruous and visually intrusive structure and where the increased domestication of the wider site would detract from the rural character of the area. In the absence of any special circumstances to justify it, the proposal represents an unsustainable and harmful form of new residential development in the countryside and without any other material considerations which outweigh such harm, the proposal is contrary to Policies 1, 2, 7, 23 and 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 (November 2016) and Paragraphs 8, 80, 130 and 174 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The application site falls within the Zone of Influence of the River Fal and Helford River Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and the Penhale Dunes SAC and it is considered that the proposal would, when considered in combination with other plans and projects, adversely affect the integrity of the SACs without the ability to mitigate.

The introduction of a dwelling on this location would diminish this important gap and bring the built form further into the countryside, to the detriment of the landscape and visual amenities of the area and contrary to Policy 1 and 3 of the Cornwall Local Plan (Strategic Policies). 2 The site now proposed for an open market dwelling formed a part of a previous development approved as a rural exception scheme, where the land take for open market housing was already above 50% of the total site area. The application site must be considered in conjunction with the adjacent site to the southeast, given that, where the splitting of a site results in two sites which are physically adjoined and access shared, the capacity and suitability of the entire developable area will be considered for the purposes of determining whether it falls above or below affordable housing thresholds. In this case, in combination with the adjoining site to the southeast, the scheme further increases the land take for open market housing and exceeds the threshold for affordable housing contributions, based on floorspace, as indicated within policy 8 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030.

Owing to the site's countryside location which is clearly divorced from the nearest 'settlement', for the purposes of Policy 3 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 (CLP); its poor accessibility other than by private modes of transport; and the proposal not meeting any of the exceptions for new residential development in the countryside, set out in Policy 7 of the CLP, it is considered to represent unsuitable and unsustainable residential development. The proposal is therefore considered to conflict with the aims and intentions of policies 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 of the CLP; and paragraphs 8 and 84 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 Whilst the site presently contains a pair of utilitarian garage buildings which do little for the character and appearance of the area, it is considered that replacing them with a more substantial and permanent holiday dwelling with large amounts of glazing which would be a conspicuous feature when viewed from the public domain (particularly outside of daylight hours) would fail to at least conserve the landscape and scenic beauty of the surrounding Cornwall AONB, the protection of which should be given great weight.

The proposed development would introduce a new unrestricted residential dwelling into the open countryside for which there are no special circumstances or justification. The dwelling would not be in a sustainable location, having particular regard to the lack of accessibility to services and facilities available locally and would give rise to dependence of future occupants on the private motor vehicle in terms of accessing such services and facilities. The narrow linear form of the site does not demonstrate a cultural, physical and aesthetic understanding of its location. The provision of a dwelling with associated access, parking, garden with associated paraphernalia would, even if extensively landscaped and with a modest dwelling of an appropriate design, change the character of the site to a more domestic appearance and suburban appearance. As a consequence, the undeveloped verdant appearance, would be unduly eroded. Furthermore, the proposal would result in the subdivision of the long narrow plot that represents a historic example of the morphology of a mining settlement that is a key attribute that expressed the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site. The proposal would sever the plot from the host dwelling resulting in backland development which would be out of keeping with the character of the area which is characterised by long rear gardens containing subservient and subordinate outbuildings which serve the associated host dwellings. The harm caused by the proposal would not be outweighed by any substantial public benefits and as such the proposed development conflicts with the aims and intentions set out within Policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 12, 13, 23 and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, policies P3, C2 and C9 of The Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site Management Plan 2020-2025 and paragraphs 8, 130, 174, 189 and 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",Minor - Dwelling,,Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,,,"['locate', 'outside', 'physical', 'boundaries', 'establish', 'uated', 'open', 'countryside', 'define', 'introduce', 'unrestricted', 'residential', 'open', 'countryside', 'special', 'sustainable', 'location', 'have', 'particular', 'regard', 'lack', 'accessibility', 'service', 'facilities', 'available', 'rise', 'dependence', 'future', 'occupants', 'private', 'motor', 'vehicle', 'term', 'access', 'service', 'facilities', 'narrow', 'linear', 'cultural', 'physical', 'aesthetic', 'understand', 'location', 'provision', 'associate', 'access', 'park', 'garden', 'associate', 'paraphernalia', 'extensively', 'landscape', 'modest', 'appropriate', 'design', 'change', 'character', 'domestic', 'appearance', 'suburban', 'appearance', 'consequence', 'undeveloped', 'verdant', 'appearance', 'unduly', 'erode', 'furthermore', 'subdivision', 'long', 'narrow', 'plot', 'historic', 'example', 'morphology', 'mine', 'attribute', 'express', 'outstanding', 'universal', 'value', 'west', 'devon', 'mine', 'landscape', 'world', 'heritage', 'sever', 'plot', 'host', 'keep', 'character', 'characterise', 'long', 'rear', 'garden', 'contain', 'subservient', 'subordinate', 'out', 'serve', 'associate', 'host', 'harm', 'cause', 'outweigh', 'substantial', 'public', 'west', 'devon', 'mine', 'landscape', 'world', 'heritage', 'management']","['locate', 'outside', 'physical', 'boundaries', 'establish', 'uated', 'open', 'countryside', 'define', 'introduce', 'unrestricted', 'residential', 'open', 'countryside', 'special', 'sustainable', 'location', 'have', 'particular', 'regard', 'lack', 'accessibility', 'service', 'facilities', 'available', 'rise', 'dependence', 'future', 'occupants', 'private', 'motor', 'vehicle', 'term', 'access', 'service', 'facilities', 'narrow', 'linear', 'cultural', 'physical', 'aesthetic', 'understand', 'location', 'provision', 'associate', 'access', 'park', 'garden', 'associate', 'paraphernalia', 'extensively', 'landscape', 'modest', 'appropriate', 'design', 'change', 'character', 'domestic', 'appearance', 'suburban', 'appearance', 'consequence', 'undeveloped', 'verdant', 'appearance', 'unduly', 'erode', 'furthermore', 'subdivision', 'long', 'narrow', 'plot', 'historic', 'example', 'morphology', 'mine', 'attribute', 'express', 'outstanding', 'universal', 'value', 'west', 'devon', 'mine', 'landscape', 'world', 'heritage', 'sever', 'plot', 'host', 'keep', 'character', 'characterise', 'long', 'rear', 'garden', 'contain', 'subservient', 'subordinate', 'out', 'serve', 'associate', 'host', 'harm', 'cause', 'outweigh', 'substantial', 'public', 'west', 'devon', 'mine', 'landscape', 'world', 'heritage', 'management']",0.37933802604675293,,0.15610702335834503,,,0.0412198044359684,,,0.1022222638130188,,0.3146449029445648,

1118,1241,PA22/02223,Proposed conversion of redundant stables to residential dwelling.,17/03/2022," 1 The site is located outside the boundaries of a defined settlement and is within the open countryside. Policy 7 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 sets out the special circumstances in which residential development within the open countryside will be considered acceptable. It has not been demonstrated that the building is suitably constructed for its intended residential use, nor is the building redundant, disused or a historic building that is considered appropriate to retain and would lead to an enhancement to the immediate setting. Furthermore, there is insufficient information to determine that the existing building and the proposed works would meet the requirement that the building is capable of being converted to a dwelling without substantial rebuilding operations. The application building is prominent when viewed from the road. The building reads as a simple and functional stable building that relates to the adjacent field and surrounding rural character of the area, the type of building which Is expected in a rural setting and as such does not appear out of place. The proposal works would give the building a new domestic character which would significantly alter the appearance of the building and its associated curtilage. The proposed development is not considered to lead to an enhancement to the immediate setting, which is open and rural, which would be eroded by the conversion works, associated domestic paraphernalia and subdivision of the open field to the north and east of the application building and as such would have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area. It is therefore concluded that the proposal would not accord with Policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraphs 8, 130 and 174 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",Minor - Dwelling,,Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,,,"['locate', 'outside', 'boundaries', 'define', 'open', 'countryside', 'set', 'special', 'residential', 'open', 'countryside', 'acceptable', 'suitably', 'construct', 'intend', 'residential', 'redundant', 'disused', 'historic', 'appropriate', 'retain', 'lead', 'enhancement', 'immediate', 'set', 'furthermore', 'insufficient', 'determine', 'exist', 'meet', 'requirement', 'capable', 'convert', 'substantial', 'operations', 'prominent', 'view', 'road', 'read', 'simple', 'functional', 'stable', 'relate', 'adjacent', 'field', 'surround', 'rural', 'character', 'type', 'expect', 'rural', 'set', 'appear', 'place', 'domestic', 'character', 'significantly', 'alter', 'appearance', 'associate', 'curtilage', 'lead', 'enhancement', 'immediate', 'set', 'open', 'rural', 'erode', 'conversion', 'associate', 'domestic', 'paraphernalia', 'subdivision', 'open', 'field', 'north', 'east', 'adverse', 'character', 'appearance', 'conclude', 'accord']","['locate', 'outside', 'boundaries', 'define', 'open', 'countryside', 'set', 'special', 'residential', 'open', 'countryside', 'acceptable', 'suitably', 'construct', 'intend', 'residential', 'redundant', 'disused', 'historic', 'appropriate', 'retain', 'lead', 'enhancement', 'immediate', 'set', 'furthermore', 'insufficient', 'determine', 'exist', 'meet', 'requirement', 'capable', 'convert', 'substantial', 'operations', 'prominent', 'view', 'road', 'read', 'simple', 'functional', 'stable', 'relate', 'adjacent', 'field', 'surround', 'rural', 'character', 'type', 'expect', 'rural', 'set', 'appear', 'place', 'domestic', 'character', 'significantly', 'alter', 'appearance', 'associate', 'curtilage', 'lead', 'enhancement', 'immediate', 'set', 'open', 'rural', 'erode', 'conversion', 'associate', 'domestic', 'paraphernalia', 'subdivision', 'open', 'field', 'north', 'east', 'adverse', 'character', 'appearance', 'conclude', 'accord']",,,0.12241716682910919,,0.4135848581790924,,,,,,0.09972874075174332,

The public benefits of a single dwelling would not be outweighed by the harm that would be caused which is considered to be less than substantial but the benefits of the scheme do not outweigh the harm that would be caused.

The site is not considered to be accessible by a range of transport modes.  The proposal would introduce various structures, i.e. shepherds huts, new workshop and toilet block, scattered throughout the site and thereby result in a proliferation of built-form in the countryside. This would result in the loss and intrinsic harm to the character and natural part of the countryside which forms part of the relic undeveloped landscape of the Tregonning and Gwinear Mining Districts of the World Heritage Site. The harm that would arise would be localised, and therefore the impact on the WHS, as a whole, would be less than substantial within the meaning of Paragraph 202 of the Framework 2021. However, less than substantial harm does not mean less than substantial weight should be afforded to this harm. Rather, as the Framework sets out, great weight should be given to the conservation of designated heritage assets. The Framework advises that less than substantial harm should be considered in a balanced manner, against any public benefits associated with the development. The public benefits of providing additional employment and tourism facilities would not outweigh the harm identified.

In the absence of any identified need, the development if approved would constitute a new dwelling in the countryside to the detriment of the rural and undeveloped nature of the site, contrary to the principles of sustainability embodied in policies 1, 2, 3 and 7 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Polices 2010-2030 (adopted November 2016) and Paragraph 80 (a) of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The application involves the construction of a new temporary workers dwelling in the countryside along with multiple buildings and structures spread across the site. The site is located within a World Heritage Site and it is considered that the proposal would result in landscape and visual harm to the area through the proliferation of the range of structures across the site.

Further, the proposed development would result in residential development and associated domestic paraphernalia encroaching upon the valley bottom which is identified as a key landscape characteristic by both permitted and emerging development proposals within the wider area and which facilitates green and blue infrastructure provision to support development within the area.

Thus, the development conflicts with Development Plan policy concerning the location of new housing development.  The proposed development, by reason of its location beyond the development boundary, would incrementally extend the settlement into the countryside and result in the harmful urbanisation of an undeveloped site which contributes to the semi-rural character of the area and setting of the settlement.

The combination of the revised and more conspicuous appearance of this functional, utilitarian building with its associated garden land, access, parking and domestic paraphernalia will be an uncharacteristic, alien and incongruous domestic addition to this otherwise open agricultural landscape.  Such harm will be accentuated by the prominence, from a public perspective, of this standalone building in an area of otherwise strong, open rural character. Such insensitive residential development in this protected landscape will not conserve the landscape character and natural beauty of the AONB AONB in this location, which is particularly sensitive and has limited capacity to accommodate further development due to its remote rural location. In giving great weight to conserving the landscape and scenic beauty of the AONB, the identified environmental harm is overriding in the planning balance and the proposal is thereby contrary to policies 1, 2, 5, 7, 12, 21 and 23 in the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030, paragraphs 8, 80, 84, 85, 110, 112, 130, 174 and 176 in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and polices PD-P1, PD-P8, PD-P11 and PD-P18 in the Cornwall AONB Management Plan 2022 - 2027. 2 The application site falls within the Zone of Influence for the Fal and Helford Special Area of Conservation (SAC), and it is considered that the proposal would, when considered in combination with other plans and projects, adversely affect the integrity of the SAC without the ability to sufficiently mitigate. Consequently, the proposal would represent Habitats Development for which no mitigation has been secured to protect the integrity of the SAC.

1169,1296,PA22/08495,Residential development of 5 dwellings on former St John's Hall site.,04/10/2022," 1 The proposed development would appear uncomfortably cramped within its plot, exacerbated by the excessive width of the building proposed, which is emphasised by its gable ends being situated in close proximity to the boundaries, thereby visually filling the plot. The inclusion of the gable end and the encroachment of the development towards its north-east boundary, which is shared with the neighbouring dwelling known as Penlea, would result in a harmful loss of light and aspect enjoyed by the occupants and future occupants of Penlea, and adversely impact upon their residential amenity. The excessive width of the proposed building is accentuated by the monotonous appearance of the principal elevation, which lacks interest and contains overly symmetrical fenestration. Its cramped appearance is emphasised by its failure to successfully integrate the parking provision within the development, which results in its frontage being dominated by vehicle parking and thus fails to respond positively and enhance the local historical context and character. By reason of the bulk, massing, design and layout, the proposed development would: fail to be visually attractive as a result of good architecture, layout and appropriate and effective landscaping; neither integrate successfully with, nor respond positively to, the locally distinctive characteristics of the area; and result in harm to the residential amenities of occupants of Penlea. Therefore, the proposed development would conflict with the aims and intentions of sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 4.2, 5.8 and 9.3 of the Cornwall Design Guide 2021, policies 1, 2 and 12 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 8, 119, 124, 126 and 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. This reason for refusal is in accordance with paragraph 134 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 By reason of the insufficient emerging visibility for vehicles egressing onto the public highway from the parking area to serve the proposed dwelling on plot no. 5, the proposed development would give rise to increased scope for conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles and result in an unacceptable impact on highway safety, in conflict with the aims and intentions of policy 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 110 and 112 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. This reason for refusal is in accordance with paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 3 In the absence of a mechanism to secure it, the proposal fails to provide contributions to deliver improvements to mitigate pressures on education infrastructure, and without which would be contrary to the aims and intentions of policy 28 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraph 95 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",Minor - Dwelling,,Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,,,"['appear', 'uncomfortably', 'cramp', 'plot', 'exacerbate', 'excessive', 'width', 'emphasise', 'gable', 'end', 'uated', 'close', 'proximity', 'boundaries', 'visually', 'fill', 'plot', 'inclusion', 'gable', 'encroachment', 'northeast', 'boundary', 'share', 'neighbour', 'know', 'penlea', 'harmful', 'loss', 'light', 'aspect', 'enjoy', 'occupants', 'future', 'occupants', 'penlea', 'adversely', 'residential', 'amenity', 'excessive', 'width', 'accentuate', 'monotonous', 'appearance', 'principal', 'elevation', 'lack', 'contain', 'overly', 'symmetrical', 'fenestration', 'cramp', 'appearance', 'emphasise', 'failure', 'successfully', 'integrate', 'park', 'provision', 'frontage', 'dominate', 'vehicle', 'park', 'fail', 'respond', 'poively', 'enhance', 'historical', 'context', 'character', 'bulk', 'mass', 'design', 'layout', 'fail', 'visually', 'attractive', 'good', 'architecture', 'layout', 'appropriate', 'effective', 'landscape', 'integrate', 'successfully', 'respond', 'poively', 'distinctive', 'characteristics', 'harm', 'residential', 'amenities', 'occupants', 'penlea', 'design', 'guide', 'refusal', 'accordance', 'insufficient', 'emerge', 'visibility', 'vehicles', 'egress', 'public', 'highway', 'park', 'serve', 'plot', 'rise', 'increase', 'scope', 'pedestrians', 'cyclists', 'vehicles', 'unacceptable', 'highway', 'safety', 'refusal', 'accordance', 'absence', 'mechanism', 'secure', 'fail', 'contributions', 'deliver', 'improvements', 'mitigate', 'pressure', 'education', 'infrastructure']","['appear', 'uncomfortably', 'cramp', 'plot', 'exacerbate', 'excessive', 'width', 'emphasise', 'gable', 'end', 'uated', 'close', 'proximity', 'boundaries', 'visually', 'fill', 'plot', 'inclusion', 'gable', 'encroachment', 'northeast', 'boundary', 'share', 'neighbour', 'know', 'penlea', 'harmful', 'loss', 'light', 'aspect', 'enjoy', 'occupants', 'future', 'occupants', 'penlea', 'adversely', 'residential', 'amenity', 'excessive', 'width', 'accentuate', 'monotonous', 'appearance', 'principal', 'elevation', 'lack', 'contain', 'overly', 'symmetrical', 'fenestration', 'cramp', 'appearance', 'emphasise', 'failure', 'successfully', 'integrate', 'park', 'provision', 'frontage', 'dominate', 'vehicle', 'park', 'fail', 'respond', 'poively', 'enhance', 'historical', 'context', 'character', 'bulk', 'mass', 'design', 'layout', 'fail', 'visually', 'attractive', 'good', 'architecture', 'layout', 'appropriate', 'effective', 'landscape', 'integrate', 'successfully', 'respond', 'poively', 'distinctive', 'characteristics', 'harm', 'residential', 'amenities', 'occupants', 'penlea', 'design', 'guide', 'refusal', 'accordance', 'insufficient', 'emerge', 'visibility', 'vehicles', 'egress', 'public', 'highway', 'park', 'serve', 'plot', 'rise', 'increase', 'scope', 'pedestrians', 'cyclists', 'vehicles', 'unacceptable', 'highway', 'safety', 'refusal', 'accordance', 'absence', 'mechanism', 'secure', 'fail', 'contributions', 'deliver', 'improvements', 'mitigate', 'pressure', 'education', 'infrastructure']",,0.03873889893293381,0.5360060334205627,,,0.19453778862953186,,,,,,0.2017381340265274

The only windows would be in the kitchen/living room on the north elevation facing onto the parking area/rear wall of the cinema. As north facing they would not receive direct sunlight, and the ground floor windows would be partially shaded by the proposed first floor balcony. The proposed design and layout of the units on the ground and first floor would result in a gloomy and oppressive living environment, thereby resulting in inadequate living conditions for future occupants. The units on the ground and first floor would not accord with the nationally described space standards the minimum gross internal floor areas. In addition, the proposed extension to the rear of the existing building, adjacent to the Trenwith Place, would be overbearing for the occupiers of Royal Cottages. The proposed development conflicts with the aims and intentions of policies 12 and 13 of the CLP, paragraph 130 of the NPPF (2021) and paragraphs 9.3.2 and 9.4.2 of the Cornwall Design Guide (2021) which all seek to ensure that developments have a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.   2 The intention of the proposal seeks to retain the Art Deco building but the defining features of the buildings of this era would be lost with the introduction of a pitched roof and dormers. The introduction of the pitched roof and dormers would not respect the character and appearance of the host building. In addition, the introduction of balconies on the front faÃ§ade would add visual clutter to the principal elevation. The proposed extension on the south elevation would introduce a built-form beyond the existing and strong building line established by Nos. 2 and 32 Trenwith Place.

The development of this site would result in a harmful urban intrusion into the countryside to the detriment of the strong rural character of the location which is designated an AONB. The development therefore fails to suitably integrate with the natural environment and will result in material harm to the landscape setting of the small settlement of Germoe Crossroads.

The proposal has not been submitted as a rural exception scheme or a development that would comply with Policy 7 of the CLP. Therefore the proposal does not represent sustainable development and is contrary to Policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 12, 21, 23 and 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and Policy H1 of the Feock Neighbourhood Development Plan 2017-2030 together with paragraphs 130 and 174 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The submitted scheme does not demonstrate safe access/egress for the proposed development with the use of the existing byways 305/1/4 and 305/1/3 which are considered unsuitable to cater for the inevitable increase in vehicle movements generated by the development by reason of the surface condition and width, and would in the opinion of the Local Planning Authority give rise to conflict with other users of the public right of way. The proposed location of this development would encourage vehicle movements in conflict with pedestrians giving rise to increased danger for all users and creating an unacceptable highway safety impact. As such the development is assessed as being in conflict with Policies 16 and 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, Policy H1 of the Feock Neighbourhood Development Plan 2017-2030 and the paragraph 110 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 3 In the absence of a mechanism to secure the provision of financial contributions to mitigate the recreation impact on the Fal and Helford Special Area of Conservation for which there is evidence of an identified need, the proposal is considered to be contrary to policy 22 of the Cornwall Local Plan and Paragraphs 174, 180 and 181 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021",Minor - Dwelling,Feock Neighbourhood Development Plan 2017-2030,"Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,Cornwall Local Plan",,,"['residential', 'acceptable', 'round', 'infill', 'define', 'extend', 'countryside', 'current', 'carnon', 'down', 'urbanise', 'extension', 'countryside', 'visual', 'coalescence', 'adjoin', 'north', 'grange', 'industrial', 'estate', 'south', 'west', 'detrimental', 'rural', 'character', 'appearance', 'submit', 'rural', 'exception', 'scheme', 'comply', 'sustainable', 'submit', 'scheme', 'safe', 'accessegress', 'exist', 'byways', 'unsuitable', 'cater', 'inevitable', 'increase', 'vehicle', 'movements', 'generate', 'surface', 'width', 'opinion', 'authority', 'rise', 'users', 'public', 'right', 'location', 'encourage', 'vehicle', 'movements', 'pedestrians', 'give', 'rise', 'increase', 'danger', 'users', 'create', 'unacceptable', 'highway', 'safety', 'assess', 'absence', 'mechanism', 'secure', 'provision', 'financial', 'contributions', 'mitigate', 'recreation', 'helford', 'special', 'conservation', 'evidence', 'identify', 'need']","['residential', 'acceptable', 'round', 'infill', 'define', 'extend', 'countryside', 'current', 'carnon', 'down', 'urbanise', 'extension', 'countryside', 'visual', 'coalescence', 'adjoin', 'north', 'grange', 'industrial', 'estate', 'south', 'west', 'detrimental', 'rural', 'character', 'appearance', 'submit', 'rural', 'exception', 'scheme', 'comply', 'sustainable', 'submit', 'scheme', 'safe', 'accessegress', 'exist', 'byways', 'unsuitable', 'cater', 'inevitable', 'increase', 'vehicle', 'movements', 'generate', 'surface', 'width', 'opinion', 'authority', 'rise', 'users', 'public', 'right', 'location', 'encourage', 'vehicle', 'movements', 'pedestrians', 'give', 'rise', 'increase', 'danger', 'users', 'create', 'unacceptable', 'highway', 'safety', 'assess', 'absence', 'mechanism', 'secure', 'provision', 'financial', 'contributions', 'mitigate', 'recreation', 'helford', 'special', 'conservation', 'evidence', 'identify', 'need']",,,,,,0.3308835029602051,,,,,,0.24660558998584747

The proposal represents an unsustainable intrusion of sporadic housing development into the open countryside, in a location which will not encourage sustainable modes of travel, with future occupiers likely to be highly dependent on a private motor vehicle, and which would also lead to visual harm through the erosion of the character and appearance of the natural environment, which is designated as an AONB, and is therefore a highly sensitive location. The proposed development would fail to conserve and enhance the landscape character and natural beauty of the Cornwall AONB. In the absence of any special circumstances to justify residential development in this context, the proposal does not represent sustainable development and therefore raises direct conflict with Policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, Policies H1, H2, L1 and L2 of the Mylor Parish Neighbourhood Development Plan 2020-2030, and paragraphs 8, 80, 130, 174, and 176 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The application has not demonstrated that a satisfactory visibility splay to the west for emerging drivers can be achieved and therefore the development fails to provide a safe and suitable access to the site for all people.

Policy 7 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 sets out the special circumstances in which residential development within the open countryside will be considered acceptable. The building is not considered to be appropriate to retain and its conversion would not lead to an enhancement to the immediate setting. The application building is prominent when viewed from the public right of way that runs past the building, only 14m away and both the building and the proposed access track would be readily visible from the road. The building reads as a simple and functional block building that relates to the adjacent field and surrounding rural character of the area, the type of building which Is expected in a rural setting and as such does not appear out of place. The proposed works would give the building a new domestic character which would significantly alter the appearance of the building and its associated curtilage. The proposed development is not considered to lead to an enhancement to the immediate setting, which is open and rural, which would be eroded by the conversion works, associated domestic paraphernalia and subdivision of the field and as such would have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area. It is therefore concluded that the proposal would not accord with Policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, Policies PD-P1, PD-P2, PD-P11 and PD-P18 of the Cornwall AONB Management Plan 2022-2027, Policies AD5, AD8 and BD8 of the St Just-in-Penwith Parish Neighbourhood Plan 2021-2030 and paragraphs 8, 130, 174 and 176 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",Minor - Dwelling,Penwith Parish Neighbourhood Plan 2021-2030,Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,,AONB,"['locate', 'outside', 'physical', 'boundaries', 'establish', 'uated', 'open', 'countryside', 'define', 'set', 'special', 'residential', 'open', 'countryside', 'acceptable', 'appropriate', 'retain', 'conversion', 'lead', 'enhancement', 'immediate', 'set', 'prominent', 'view', 'public', 'right', 'run', 'past', 'away', 'access', 'track', 'readily', 'visible', 'road', 'read', 'simple', 'functional', 'block', 'relate', 'adjacent', 'field', 'surround', 'rural', 'character', 'type', 'expect', 'rural', 'set', 'appear', 'place', 'domestic', 'character', 'significantly', 'alter', 'appearance', 'associate', 'curtilage', 'lead', 'enhancement', 'immediate', 'set', 'open', 'rural', 'erode', 'conversion', 'associate', 'domestic', 'paraphernalia', 'subdivision', 'field', 'adverse', 'character', 'appearance', 'conclude', 'accord', 'aonb', 'management', 'justin']","['locate', 'outside', 'physical', 'boundaries', 'establish', 'uated', 'open', 'countryside', 'define', 'set', 'special', 'residential', 'open', 'countryside', 'acceptable', 'appropriate', 'retain', 'conversion', 'lead', 'enhancement', 'immediate', 'set', 'prominent', 'view', 'public', 'right', 'run', 'past', 'away', 'access', 'track', 'readily', 'visible', 'road', 'read', 'simple', 'functional', 'block', 'relate', 'adjacent', 'field', 'surround', 'rural', 'character', 'type', 'expect', 'rural', 'set', 'appear', 'place', 'domestic', 'character', 'significantly', 'alter', 'appearance', 'associate', 'curtilage', 'lead', 'enhancement', 'immediate', 'set', 'open', 'rural', 'erode', 'conversion', 'associate', 'domestic', 'paraphernalia', 'subdivision', 'field', 'adverse', 'character', 'appearance', 'conclude', 'accord', 'aonb', 'management', 'justin']",,,0.1311274617910385,,0.4609282612800598,,,,0.023755820468068123,,0.06542345136404037,

The proposed development is therefore considered to be contrary to policies 2 and 12 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. The refusal of planning permission complies with paragraph 134 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 that development that is not well designed should be refused. 2 The tandem development would result in an undesirable relationship with the host dwelling and the neighbouring dwelling to the west, by creating a narrow, unsuitable access that leads through to the rear of the site, resulting in an increase in noise and disturbance by way of increased car journeys, affecting the residential enjoyment of these properties.

The fallback position at the site has been acknowledged along with the degree of harm which would be caused however the proposed scheme, which includes a modern dwelling, incorporation of land for garden and creation of an approximately 40 metres driveway through an agricultural land parcel along with the associated parking and turning area will fundamentally alter the perception of the building in the setting and introduce a greater level of urbanisation and domestic paraphernalia, such that it will be recognised as an incongruous residential form which will harm the rural characteristics of this landscape. Given the inappropriate and unsustainable form of new housing development in the countryside, the proposed development fails to maintain and enhance the landscape character in this location. As such, it conflicts with policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 12 and 23 in the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030, policies 1, 6, 7, 18 of the Lanner Neighbourhood Development Plan 2017-2030 and paragraphs 8, 11, 80, 105, 126, 130 and 174 in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",Minor - Dwelling,Lanner Neighbourhood Development Plan 2017-2030,Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,,,"['location', 'open', 'countryside', 'residential', 'adequately', 'poion', 'acknowledge', 'degree', 'harm', 'cause', 'scheme', 'include', 'modern', 'incorporation', 'garden', 'creation', 'approximately', 'metres', 'driveway', 'agricultural', 'parcel', 'associate', 'park', 'turn', 'fundamentally', 'alter', 'perception', 'set', 'introduce', 'greater', 'level', 'urbanisation', 'domestic', 'paraphernalia', 'recognise', 'incongruous', 'residential', 'harm', 'rural', 'characteristics', 'landscape', 'give', 'inappropriate', 'unsustainable', 'countryside', 'fail', 'maintain', 'enhance', 'landscape', 'character', 'location']","['location', 'open', 'countryside', 'residential', 'adequately', 'poion', 'acknowledge', 'degree', 'harm', 'cause', 'scheme', 'include', 'modern', 'incorporation', 'garden', 'creation', 'approximately', 'metres', 'driveway', 'agricultural', 'parcel', 'associate', 'park', 'turn', 'fundamentally', 'alter', 'perception', 'set', 'introduce', 'greater', 'level', 'urbanisation', 'domestic', 'paraphernalia', 'recognise', 'incongruous', 'residential', 'harm', 'rural', 'characteristics', 'landscape', 'give', 'inappropriate', 'unsustainable', 'countryside', 'fail', 'maintain', 'enhance', 'landscape', 'character', 'location']",0.26498380303382874,,,,0.37207266688346863,,0.11630097031593323,,,,,
1213,1343,PA22/05347,Proposed extensions (reduced and revised application following withdrawn application PA21/04671).,07/07/2022," 1 The extensions by reason of their scale and design would significantly detract from the architectural merits of the original building. The scale and contrast in appearance of the extensions impairs the attractiveness of the existing building diminishing its historic interest by drawing attention away from the original building. In addition, the level of glazing would result in substantial expanses of light spill within the West Penwith International Dark Sky Park. The proposed development would harm the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and surrounding area and the small economic gain through the construction of the extensions is not considered a public benefit that outweighs the identified harm with particular regard to Policy 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraph 203 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. The proposed development would harm the character and appearance of the host dwelling as well as its significance as a non-designated heritage asset and would result in additional light spill in conflict with the aims and intentions set out within Policies 1, 2, 12, 23 and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, paragraphs 8, 130, 174, 176 and 203 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and policies PD-P1, PD-P2 and PD-P11 of the Cornwall AONB Management Plan 2022-2027. 2 In the absence of an ecological survey to identify the presence and impact on protected species, the Local Planning Authority are unable to assess whether the development would adversely impact on biodiversity and the ecological value of the site, with specific regard to protected species. The proposed development therefore fails to comply with the aims and intentions set out within Policies 1 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, paragraphs 8, 174 and 180 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended).",Householder,,Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,,AONB,"['extensions', 'scale', 'design', 'significantly', 'detract', 'architectural', 'merit', 'original', 'scale', 'contrast', 'appearance', 'extensions', 'impair', 'attractiveness', 'exist', 'diminish', 'historic', 'draw', 'attention', 'away', 'original', 'addition', 'level', 'glaze', 'substantial', 'expanses', 'light', 'spill', 'west', 'penwith', 'inter', 'dark', 'park', 'harm', 'character', 'appearance', 'exist', 'surround', 'small', 'economic', 'gain', 'construction', 'extensions', 'public', 'outweigh', 'identify', 'harm', 'particular', 'regard', 'harm', 'character', 'appearance', 'host', 'significance', 'nondesignated', 'heritage', 'asset', 'additional', 'light', 'spill', 'aonb', 'management', 'absence', 'ecological', 'survey', 'presence', 'protect', 'species', 'authority', 'unable', 'assess', 'adversely', 'biodivery', 'ecological', 'value', 'specific', 'regard', 'protect', 'species', 'fail', 'comply', 'wildlife', 'countryside', 'amend']","['extensions', 'scale', 'design', 'significantly', 'detract', 'architectural', 'merit', 'original', 'scale', 'contrast', 'appearance', 'extensions', 'impair', 'attractiveness', 'exist', 'diminish', 'historic', 'draw', 'attention', 'away', 'original', 'addition', 'level', 'glaze', 'substantial', 'expanses', 'light', 'spill', 'west', 'penwith', 'inter', 'dark', 'park', 'harm', 'character', 'appearance', 'exist', 'surround', 'small', 'economic', 'gain', 'construction', 'extensions', 'public', 'outweigh', 'identify', 'harm', 'particular', 'regard', 'harm', 'character', 'appearance', 'host', 'significance', 'nondesignated', 'heritage', 'asset', 'additional', 'light', 'spill', 'aonb', 'management', 'absence', 'ecological', 'survey', 'presence', 'protect', 'species', 'authority', 'unable', 'assess', 'adversely', 'biodivery', 'ecological', 'value', 'specific', 'regard', 'protect', 'species', 'fail', 'comply', 'wildlife', 'countryside', 'amend']",,,0.28475552797317505,0.19297048449516296,,,,,0.4643521308898926,,,
1214,1344,PA22/05269,Change of use of recreational building into a holiday-let,17/08/2022," 1 The use of the permitted recreation building as a holiday dwelling would represent unsustainable new development within the open countryside for which no special need or justification has been adequately demonstrated. The site is therefore not deemed to be an appropriate location for the expansion and upgrading of existing tourism accommodation at the site and moreover, the proposal represents a form of housing in the open countryside for which no special circumstances have been identified to justify it. Such unsustainable development in the countryside is inaccessible by a range of transport modes other than the private motor car and therefore raises direct conflict with policies 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 27 in the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 8, 80, 84, 85, 103 and 112 in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The application site falls within the Zone of Influence of the River Fal and Helford River Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and it is considered that the proposal would when considered in combination with other plans and projects, adversely affects the integrity of the SAC without the ability to mitigate.

Nor does the proposed development accord with the exceptions criteria for dwellings in the countryside set out at Policies 7 and 21 of the Cornwall Local Plan 2010-2030. 2 The proposed vehicle access from the C0005 has an inadequate visibility splay for emerging vehicles resulting in an access which is neither safe nor suitable. There is no convenient pedestrian footway with lighting to the bus stops and access to bus stops is along a busy road thus the proposal does not provide a safe or suitable access for all users. The proposal conflicts with Cornwall Local Plan 2010-2030 Policy 27 and paragraph 110(b) of the National Planning Policy Framework. 3 No assessment of the impact on ecology has been undertaken by the applicant thus the local planning authority has been unable to assess whether the proposals would have a significant impact on protected species, including European protected species, or biodiversity generally or to assess whether, if impacts exist, that they can be satisfactorily mitigated. The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan 2010-2030 and paragraphs 174 (d) and 180 (a) of the National Planning Policy Framework. 4 The application site falls within the Zone of Influence of the Fal and Helford Estuaries Special Area of Conservation and the Penhale Dunes Special Area of Conservation and it is considered that the proposal would when considered in combination with other plans and projects, adversely affects the integrity of these Special Areas of Conservation without the ability to mitigate.

The proposal therefore conflicts with Policy 12, 23 and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan 2010-2030 and paragraphs 130 (a, c), 174 (b) and 197 of the National Planning Policy Framework and conflicts with Policies P3 and C3 of the World Heritage Site Management Plan.

Policy 7 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 sets out the special circumstances in which residential development within the open countryside will be considered acceptable. The building is not considered to be appropriate to retain and its conversion would not lead to an enhancement to the immediate setting. The building reads as a simple and functional timber outbuilding that relates to the adjacent agricultural building and surrounding rural character of the area, the type of building which Is expected in a rural setting and as such does not appear out of place. The proposed works would give the building a new domestic character which would significantly alter the appearance of the building and its associated curtilage. The proposed development is not considered to lead to an enhancement to the immediate setting, which is open and rural, which would be eroded by the conversion works, associated domestic paraphernalia and additional domestic light spill through the intensification of the use of the building and as such would have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area.

The submitted Viability Appraisal and Costs Appraisal is not in accordance with Government Guidance contained in the Planning Practice Guidance and paragraph 58 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021). As such the application contains insufficient evidence and justification for the scheme to deliver no affordable housing. 2 The proposed development would involve the partial retention and conversion of the existing relatively modern utilitarian buildings which do not make a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the area. There is no overriding reason to retain any of the buildings within the application site. The retention and conversion of an existing building on the site would result in a contrived design giving rise to a poor standard of amenity for future occupiers and a poor site layout. In particular, units 14 - 20, due to the orientation, single aspect and lack of direct natural ventilation into living spaces would have inadequate living conditions for future occupants. The proposed parking layout, in respect of units 1 - 5 would give rise to pedestrian and vehicle conflict thereby failing to provide a safe and suitable access to the site for all people. Although each unit would have a small provision of private amenity space the areas between the dwellings would be laid to hardstanding used for car parking. This is not considered to be an enhancement on the current appearance of the site. The proposal has failed to improve the appearance of the site by including a site specific landscaping scheme. For the reasons outlined the proposal has failed to seize the opportunity to enhance or better reveal the significance of the designated heritage assets and their setting which is impacted upon by the proposed development.

The proposal therefore represents an unsustainable intrusion of sporadic housing development into the open countryside, in a location which will not encourage sustainable modes of travel, with future occupiers likely to be highly dependent on a private motor vehicle, and which would also lead to visual harm through the erosion of the character and appearance of the natural environment, which is designated as an AONB, and is therefore a highly sensitive location. The proposed development would fail to conserve and enhance the landscape character and natural beauty of the Cornwall AONB.

1235,1367,PA21/11130,Conversion and change of use of domestic garage into a residential premises.,13/07/2022," 1 The proposed development would result in the subdivision of the plot serving 20 North Street. The extant plot acts as a surviving record of the morphology of the historic mining settlement, which is a key attribute that expresses the Outstanding Universal Value of the Camborne and Redruth Mining District World Heritage Site (WHS) and makes a positive contribution to the significance of the WHS as a heritage asset. By developing the site as a separate residential unit, the plot would be severed from its historic functional relationship with the host dwelling, thereby eroding its historic character and overwriting the morphology of the historic plots to the detriment of their authenticity and legibility. The resulting harm to the significance of the WHS is graded as less than substantial, and such harm is neither wholly exceptional nor is it capable of being outweighed by any public benefit arising from the proposal. Therefore, the proposed development would conflict with the aims and intentions of policies 1, 2, 12 and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030, paragraphs 8, 130, 189, 197, 199 and 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, policies P3, C2, C9 of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site Management Plan 2020 - 2025 and paragraph 3.2.1 of the Cornwall Design Guide 2021. 2 The proposed development, by reason of its cramped and contrived form, would fail to provide an acceptable standard of useable and functional private amenity space amenity for future occupiers.

Instead, it will alter the utilitarian and functional appearance of the existing building and associated land which, at present, clearly relates to this rural landscape. The addition of new openings and introduction of domestic paraphernalia on associated land will fundamentally alter the perception of the building in the setting, such that it will be recognised as an incongruous residential form which will harm the rural characteristics of this landscape.

The development would therefore go beyond the scope of the re-use of suitably constructed redundant or disused buildings in the countryside for residential use. This would represent an unsustainable form of housing development in the open countryside and by reason of its design, form, scale and functional appearance, the works would not lead to an enhancement to the immediate setting and harm the character and appearance of the countryside in this location. Finally, and by reason of the scale of the proposal and inappropriate site layout, the development would result in substandard living conditions for future occupants of the two bedroom unit in terms of the inadequate provision of recreational and functional outside space. The proposed development is therefore contrary to policies 1, 2, 7, 12, 13, 16, 21 and 23 in the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 8, 130, 134 and 174 in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 2021.   2 In the absence of up to date ecological survey work to identify the potential presence of European and UK protected species, the proposal fails to adequately demonstrate how the development would impact upon species protected by law. In the absence of up to date ecological survey work, the Local Planning Authority is unable to assess whether adverse harm would be generated with respect to protected species and hence the development is contrary to the aims of policies 2 and 23 in the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 174 and 180 in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 2021.

This would exacerbate an existing hazardous situation for pedestrians and drivers with the increase in traffic generation and vehicle movements to and from the site inevitably associated with the use of the existing dwelling as a children's pre-school nursery. In the absence of information to demonstrate otherwise, safe and suitable access to the development for all people is therefore not provided and the application is contrary to Policy 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraphs 110 and 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The proposed development would result in the substantial loss of an existing stone-faced hedgebank and associated mature Sycamore tree and landscape structure along the existing site roadside frontage on the south western side of Kenwyn Road, which is considered to contribute positively to the character and appearance of the Truro Conservation Area. Having regard to paragraph 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, the proposal is therefore considered to result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Conservation Area as a designed heritage asset, with the public benefits of the proposal in terms of the provision of a new children's pre-school nursery and associated access improvement works not outweighing this harm.

In the absence of any special circumstances to justify it, the proposal represents an unsustainable and sporadic form of development in the countryside and, in the absence of any other material considerations which outweigh such harm, the proposal is contrary to Policies 1, 3, 7 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 (November 2016). 2 In the absence of a Heritage Impact Assessment, an Archaeological desk-based assessment and, where necessary, a field evaluation, the Local Planning Authority is unable to assess the potential impacts of the development on heritage assets within the immediate vicinity including the suspected Chelsfield Barrow Group Scheduled Ancient Monument.

1412,1582,PA21/07541,Creation of parking space for one vehicle,27/08/2021," 1 The proposed removal of a proportion of the hedge and front garden to create a parking area would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the historic core of the village, setting of the cottages (identified as non-designated heritage assets) and the Area of Great Landscape Value. The subsequent positioning of a car on the front garden area would further erode the integrity of the properties' historic frontage and urbanise the semi-rural and historic context. This would conflict with policies 2,12, 23 and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 (Adopted 22nd November 2016), paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and Policy 7 of the Cleer Parish Neighbourhood Development Plan 2020 to 2030. 2 The development would erode the already limited front amenity space resulting in inadequate provision for current and future residents of the host dwelling. The positioning of a car would also harm the neighbouring dwelling's ability to enjoy their amenity space and result in unacceptable loss of privacy as a result of hedge removal and uneighbourly impact. The application is therefore contrary to policies 12 and 13 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030, paragraphs 126 and 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and section 5.5 of the Cornwall Council Design Guide March 2013. 3 Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the site is able to provide sufficient manoeuvring space off road, to allow vehicles to turn with ease in order to access and exit the site safely. There is a possibility vehicles would manoeuvre directly adjacent to this C classified road to the detriment of highway safety.

The proposed works materially reduce the visual quality of the host building and the setting, which is located within an AONB, to which the National Planning Policy Framework affords the highest status of protection. The National Planning Policy Framework requires harm to be weighed against the public benefit of the proposals. In this case the harm of the proposed balcony and associated works has been set out above. Although the private benefits and minor economic benefits of the provision of the balcony are appreciated, the proposed works would result in less than substantial harm in relation to a non-designated heritage asset and its setting, that are not balanced by these factors or other factors acting in the public interest.The proposal is contrary to the aims and intentions of Policies 2 (paragraphs 1a to 1d), 12 (paragraphs 1a and 1b), 23 (paragraphs 2 , 2a and 2b) and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 (Adopted 22nd November 2016); Sections 1, 2.6, 2.9, 2.10, 7.6 and 7.8 of the Cornwall Design Guide 2013; paragraphs 126, 130, 134, 194, 197(c), 199, 203, 176 and 178 and of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, and the advice of the Cornwall Council Domestic Alterations and Extensions Guide 2017 (pg 12).

In the absence of any special circumstances to justify residential development in this rural location, including compelling evidence of an essential need for the proposed type of accommodation in this specific location, the proposal is not sustainable development and is contrary to Policies 1, 2, 3, 7 and 21 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraphs 80, 92, 104, 112, and 174 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The site lies within Special Development Area E of the St Minver Neighbourhood Development Plan 2017-2030 that is allocated for business/industrial use under Policy STMNDP2.3. This development if permitted would introduce a residential use into this allocated site that would conflict with the aims and intentions of the policy to encourage economic growth in this area and potentially undermine the viability of this allocation by introducing a residential element that could result in an amenity conflict with some industrial activities and therefore prevent future development from locating on this site.

1436,1609,PA21/06257,Installation of Juliet Balconies & Associated Works,16/06/2021," 1 The proposed enlarged openings/Juliet balconies appear incongruous and inappropriate in the context of the character and form of the existing converted barn, and the proposed works materially reduce the visual quality of the streetscape. The proposed works fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Boscaswell Conservation Area, which is located within an AONB The National Planning Policy Framework requires harm to be weighed against the public benefit of the proposals. In this case the harm of the proposed Juliet balconies and associated works has been set out above. Although the private benefits and minor economic benefits of the insertion of Juliet balconies are appreciated, the proposed works would result in less than substantial harm in relation to the Conservation Area and its setting that are not balanced by these factors or other factors acting in the public interest.The proposal is therefore contrary to the aims and intentions of Policies 2 (paragraphs 1a to 1d), 12 (paragraphs 1a and 1b), 23 (paragraphs 2 , 2a and 2b) and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 (Adopted 22nd November 2016); Sections 1, 2.6, 2.9, 2.10 and 7.8 of the Cornwall Design Guide 2013; and paragraphs 126, 130, 134, 194, 197(c), 199, 202, 176, 178 and 189 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. The proposed development does not accord with the local planning authority's statutory duty under section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 because it would not preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. 2 The proposed Juliet balconies, due to their design and location, would result in an unacceptable increase in overlooking and disturbance in relation to the immediately adjacent garden area of 17 Boscaswell Village. The extremely close proximity of the proposed Juliet balconies allows for a significant increase in levels of overlooking and disturbance to the users of 17 Boscaswell Village that is considered intrusive, unreasonable and of harm beyond that of the reasonable levels of privacy currently enjoyed at this property. The proposed Juliet balconies would raise concerns relating to the impact upon the occupiers of neighbouring property that are not balanced by other factors acting in the public interest.The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 12 paragraphs 2a and 2c of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 (Adopted 22nd November 2016); Section 2.6 (bullet point 1); Section 4.1 (bullet point 1) and Section 4.11 (bullet point 1) of the Cornwall Design Guide 2013; and paragraphs 126, 130, 132 and 134 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021",Householder,,Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,,AONB,"['enlarge', 'openingsjuliet', 'balconies', 'appear', 'incongruous', 'inappropriate', 'context', 'character', 'exist', 'convert', 'barn', 'materially', 'reduce', 'visual', 'quality', 'stscape', 'fail', 'preserve', 'character', 'appearance', 'boscaswell', 'conservation', 'locate', 'aonb', 'require', 'harm', 'weigh', 'public', 'case', 'harm', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'associate', 'private', 'minor', 'economic', 'insertion', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'appreciate', 'substantial', 'harm', 'relation', 'conservation', 'set', 'act', 'public', 'interestthe', 'design', 'guide', 'accord', 'authoritys', 'statutory', 'duty', 'list', 'conservation', 'preserve', 'enhance', 'character', 'appearance', 'conservation', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'design', 'location', 'unacceptable', 'increase', 'overlook', 'disturbance', 'relation', 'immediately', 'adjacent', 'garden', 'boscaswell', 'village', 'extremely', 'close', 'proximity', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'allow', 'significant', 'increase', 'level', 'overlook', 'disturbance', 'users', 'boscaswell', 'village', 'intrusive', 'unable', 'harm', 'able', 'level', 'privacy', 'currently', 'enjoy', 'property', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'concern', 'relate', 'occupiers', 'neighbour', 'property', 'act', 'public', 'interestthe', 'bullet', 'bullet', 'bullet', 'design', 'guide']","['enlarge', 'openingsjuliet', 'balconies', 'appear', 'incongruous', 'inappropriate', 'context', 'character', 'exist', 'convert', 'barn', 'materially', 'reduce', 'visual', 'quality', 'stscape', 'fail', 'preserve', 'character', 'appearance', 'boscaswell', 'conservation', 'locate', 'aonb', 'require', 'harm', 'weigh', 'public', 'case', 'harm', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'associate', 'private', 'minor', 'economic', 'insertion', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'appreciate', 'substantial', 'harm', 'relation', 'conservation', 'set', 'act', 'public', 'interestthe', 'design', 'guide', 'accord', 'authoritys', 'statutory', 'duty', 'list', 'conservation', 'preserve', 'enhance', 'character', 'appearance', 'conservation', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'design', 'location', 'unacceptable', 'increase', 'overlook', 'disturbance', 'relation', 'immediately', 'adjacent', 'garden', 'boscaswell', 'village', 'extremely', 'close', 'proximity', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'allow', 'significant', 'increase', 'level', 'overlook', 'disturbance', 'users', 'boscaswell', 'village', 'intrusive', 'unable', 'harm', 'able', 'level', 'privacy', 'currently', 'enjoy', 'property', 'juliet', 'balconies', 'concern', 'relate', 'occupiers', 'neighbour', 'property', 'act', 'public', 'interestthe', 'bullet', 'bullet', 'bullet', 'design', 'guide']",,0.41865265369415283,,,,,,,0.33103641867637634,,,

1438,1611,PA21/06158,Amendments to Existing Roof Structure and Associated Works,14/06/2021," 1 The addition of a pitched roof dormer to the roof would be wholly at odds with and would be seen in stark contrast to the single storey roof of the existing dwelling. The pitched roof dormer would project above the existing roof line and would be seen as an awkward and incongruous addition that would neither reflect nor respect the form of the existing dwelling. The proposal would cause less than substantial harm to the special interest and significance of Conservation Area. In these circumstances, paragraph 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021(NPPF) states that the harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal. The benefit of the dormer addition would not sufficiently offset the adverse impacts upon the character of the Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore fail to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Conservation Area. The proposed development is in conflict with Policies 2, 12 and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, paragraphs 126, 130, 174-178 and 194-208 of the National Planning policy Framework 2021 and contrary to the duty of the local planning authority stipulated by Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.The proposed development would also be detrimental to the character of the AONB and therefore is in conflict with Policy 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraph 176 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and policy MD9 of the Cornwall AONB Management Plan 2016-2021. 2 The addtion of a pitched roof dormer by reason of its design and relationship to the neighbouring properties would give rise to an overbearing impact to the occupiers of the properties either side of the proposed development resulting in a significantly diminished unsatisfactory outlook. The proposal represents poor design in terms of resultant roof shape and the poor relationship between neighbouring properties gives rise to a poor level of amenity and substandard living environment for all occupiers.

1456,1630,PA21/05146,Extension of Existing Dwelling to Form Separate Dwelling House and Associated Works,17/05/2021," 1 Due to the constrained parameters of the plot, the proposed dwelling would be built-up immediately adjacent to the boundary shared with No. 2 Hayle Road, the neighbouring dwelling to the south-east. By reason of the constrained parameters of the plot, together with the scale, form, appearance and layout of the proposal, the proposed dwelling would loom above the boundary shared with No. 2 Hayle Road, resulting in harmful sense of enclosure and oppressiveness experienced within the rear garden of this neighbouring dwelling. The proposal would therefore fail to achieve a high standard of amenity for the occupants of the neighbouring property as a result of the harmful overbearing impacts identified. As such, the proposal would be contrary to the aims and intentions of policies HT1 and HT4 of the Crowan Neighbourhood Development Plan 2018 - 2030, policies 1 and 12 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraphs 8 and 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 Policy FAS4 of the Crowan Neighbourhood Development Plan 2018 - 2030 states that, on any new development, sufficient on-site parking must be included to ensure that no additional on-street parking is required, with at least two spaces provided per small unit (1-2 beds) and more for larger units (3+ beds). Due to the constrained parameters of the parking area proposed to serve the existing and proposed dwellings, it would not be possible to safely park and turn four vehicles without egressing onto the adjoining carriageway in a reverse gear. When egressing onto the B3302 in a reverse gear, the visibility of oncoming traffic approaching from the south-east would be severely constrained by the presence of the neighbouring dwelling, thereby raising potential for vehicular conflict. Therefore, the development proposal fails to demonstrate that safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved by all vehicular users which results in conflict with policy 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraph 110 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.

The existing dwelling and those adjacent have evidential and historical value in that they are a tangible and legible representation of past lives and the activities within this section of the WHS, such that the existing dwelling is deemed to be a non-designated heritage asset which adds to the overall significance of the WHS being a designated heritage asset. The loss of the existing dwelling, which is an irreplaceable resource, would result in the loss of a non-designated heritage asset and less than substantial harm to the significance of the WHS. The resulting harm to the authenticity and integrity of the WHS is not wholly exceptional nor is it outweighed by any substantial public benefits. Furthermore, by reason of its form, footprint and design, the extension proposed to accommodate the new flats would fail to harmonise with the character and appearance of the existing terrace of historic cottages, thereby failing to promote local distinctiveness and respond positively to the landscape.

Policy 7 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 sets out the special circumstances in which residential development within the open countryside will be considered acceptable. It has not been demonstrated that the building is suitably constructed for its intended residential use, nor is the building redundant, disused or a historic building that is considered appropriate to retain and would lead to an enhancement to the immediate setting. Furthermore, there is insufficient information to determine that the existing building and the proposed works would meet the requirement that the building is capable of being converted to a dwelling without substantial rebuilding operations. The application building is prominent when viewed from the road. The building reads as a simple and functional agricultural building that relates to the adjacent field and surrounding rural character of the area, the type of building which Is expected in a rural setting and as such does not appear out of place. The proposal would introduce large areas of glazing giving the building a new domestic character which would significantly alter the appearance of the building. The proposed development is not considered to lead to an enhancement to the immediate setting, which is open and rural, which would be eroded by the conversion works, associated domestic paraphernalia and subdivision of the open field to the south and west of the application building and as such would have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area.

The redevelopment of the land for housing is likely to result in the future pressure to develop the adjoining area of open countryside to the north-east, which is borne out by the unauthorised erection of a new stables and planning application to further expand the business currently under consideration by the Local Planning Authority. The application fails to demonstrate that the loss of this site for equestrian and other associated uses would not result in an adverse impact on the existing business and give rise to further pressure to development the open area to the north-east. While also putting pressure on the development of the open countryside, the scheme itself would result in an adverse impact to the character of the area by reason of its poor layout, finish and landscaping, including the loss of the existing Cornish hedge boundary. As a whole, the development would fail to create the conditions in which the existing business can expand and adapt without harming the character and appearance of adjoining open countryside and would fail to promote local distinctiveness and preserve the existing landscape qualities. The proposed development therefore results in conflict with the aims and intentions of policies 1, 2, 5, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 8, 81, 84, 130 and 174 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The alignment of the boundary hedge to the west of the proposed access precludes forward visibility of the access for approaching vehicles, and the emerging visibility from the access onto the highway is inadequate taking into account the speeds of passing vehicles. In the absence of sufficient visibility splays provided at the access to the site, the proposal fails to demonstrate that safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users and would result in an unacceptable impact on highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraph 110 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.

Furthermore, due to the scale and site layout, the proposal would result in unacceptable overbearing and overshadowing impacts upon the south facing windows of the neighbouring dwelling known as Penney Cottage, 3 North Road. It does not demonstrate a cultural, physical and aesthetic understanding of its location and does not preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the area which is designated as being within the Goldsithney Conservation Area and the Tregonning and Gwinear Mining Districts World Heritage Site. The proposed development would harm the character and appearance of the surrounding area and the modest contribution to the housing stock and small economic gain through the construction of the dwelling are not considered benefits that outweigh this identified harm with particular regard to paragraph 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. The proposed development fails to preserve and enhance the character and appearance of the Goldsithney Conservation Area and the Tregonning and Gwinear Mining Districts World Heritage Site and would give rise to residential amenity harm in conflict with the aims and intentions set out within policies 1, 2, 12 and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and paragraphs 8, 130, 134 and section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The application is for a two-bed dwelling with an absence of adequate parking provisions. Given that the location of the settlement is such that sustainable transport options are infrequent, and residents would be reliant on private motor vehicles to access service and facilities. The absence of adequate parking would lead to the exacerbation of existing on-street parking issues in the locale of the site and is against the aims contained within Policy 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan. As a result, the proposal does not represent sustainable development and would be contrary to Policies 1, 2 and 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and sections 2, 8 and 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 (NPPF).",Minor - Dwelling,,Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,,,"['virtue', 'gableend', 'face', 'roadside', 'layout', 'setback', 'exist', 'eaves', 'ridge', 'heights', 'appear', 'incongruous', 'set', 'disrupt', 'layout', 'characteristics', 'establish', 'line', 'western', 'north', 'road', 'furthermore', 'scale', 'layout', 'unacceptable', 'overbear', 'overshadow', 'south', 'face', 'windows', 'neighbour', 'know', 'penney', 'cottage', 'north', 'road', 'cultural', 'physical', 'aesthetic', 'understand', 'location', 'preserve', 'enhance', 'character', 'appearance', 'designate', 'goldhney', 'conservation', 'tregonning', 'gwinear', 'mine', 'district', 'world', 'heritage', 'harm', 'character', 'appearance', 'surround', 'modest', 'contribution', 'stock', 'small', 'economic', 'gain', 'construction', 'outweigh', 'identify', 'harm', 'particular', 'regard', 'fail', 'preserve', 'enhance', 'character', 'appearance', 'goldhney', 'conservation', 'tregonning', 'gwinear', 'mine', 'district', 'world', 'heritage', 'rise', 'residential', 'amenity', 'harm', 'list', 'conservation', 'twobed', 'absence', 'adequate', 'park', 'provision', 'give', 'location', 'sustainable', 'transport', 'options', 'infrequent', 'residents', 'reliant', 'private', 'motor', 'vehicles', 'access', 'service', 'facilities', 'absence', 'adequate', 'park', 'lead', 'exacerbation', 'exist', 'onst', 'park', 'issue', 'contain', 'sustainable']","['virtue', 'gableend', 'face', 'roadside', 'layout', 'setback', 'exist', 'eaves', 'ridge', 'heights', 'appear', 'incongruous', 'set', 'disrupt', 'layout', 'characteristics', 'establish', 'line', 'western', 'north', 'road', 'furthermore', 'scale', 'layout', 'unacceptable', 'overbear', 'overshadow', 'south', 'face', 'windows', 'neighbour', 'know', 'penney', 'cottage', 'north', 'road', 'cultural', 'physical', 'aesthetic', 'understand', 'location', 'preserve', 'enhance', 'character', 'appearance', 'designate', 'goldhney', 'conservation', 'tregonning', 'gwinear', 'mine', 'district', 'world', 'heritage', 'harm', 'character', 'appearance', 'surround', 'modest', 'contribution', 'stock', 'small', 'economic', 'gain', 'construction', 'outweigh', 'identify', 'harm', 'particular', 'regard', 'fail', 'preserve', 'enhance', 'character', 'appearance', 'goldhney', 'conservation', 'tregonning', 'gwinear', 'mine', 'district', 'world', 'heritage', 'rise', 'residential', 'amenity', 'harm', 'list', 'conservation', 'twobed', 'absence', 'adequate', 'park', 'provision', 'give', 'location', 'sustainable', 'transport', 'options', 'infrequent', 'residents', 'reliant', 'private', 'motor', 'vehicles', 'access', 'service', 'facilities', 'absence', 'adequate', 'park', 'lead', 'exacerbation', 'exist', 'onst', 'park', 'issue', 'contain', 'sustainable']",0.0789644867181778,,0.28956687450408936,,,0.160800039768219,,,0.3368169367313385,,,

The estate has a spacious and open appearance which has arisen from a generous layout and low density with dwellings being served with front and rear gardens. The proposed development would be at odds with the established character and appearance of the estate and would fail to respect its form and traditional pattern of development. The proposed development is considered an intrusive and overbearing form of development which would result in harm to visual and residential amenity by reason of its cramped and contrived form. The standard of living space and private amenity space that could be provided within this constricted site would be poor. In addition the proximity of the windows on the eastern elevation as indicated on drawing no J80711 to the rear garden of number 60 would result in unacceptable overlooking of the host dwelling.

The building is not considered to be a suitably constructed, redundant, rural building which would be considered appropriate to retain, and its conversion to residential use would clearly not lead to an enhancement to the immediate setting on a site which is visible from the nearby rural highway.

The resulting harm to the authenticity and integrity of the Outstanding Universal Value of the World Heritage Site would not be wholly exceptional nor would there be any overriding public benefits.

The proposal would cause less than substantial harm to the special interest and significance of Conservation Area. In these circumstances, paragraph 196 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 (NPPF) states that the harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal. The benefit of a partial raising of the roof would not sufficiently offset the adverse impacts upon the character of the Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore fail to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Conservation Area. The proposed development is in conflict with Policies 2, 12 and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, paragraphs 127, 130 and 131 and section 16 of the National Planning policy Framework 2019 and contrary to the duty of the local planning authority stipulated by Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990.The proposed development would also be detrimental to the character of the AONB and therefore is in conflict with Policy 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraph 172 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 and policy MD9 of the Cornwall AONB Management Plan 2016-2021. 2 The partial extending of the roof by reason of its design and relationship to the neighbouring properties would give rise to an overbearing impact to the occupiers of the properties either side of the proposed development resulting in a significantly diminished unsatisfactory outlook.  In addition, there would be significant overshadowing of neighbouring properties and of the courtyard. The proposal represents poor design in terms of resultant roof shape and the poor relationship between neighbouring properties gives rise to a poor level of amenity and substandard living environment for all occupiers.  The proposal therefore fails to accord with policy 12 of Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",Householder,,Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies,,AONB,"['partial', 'extend', 'roof', 'wholly', 'odds', 'see', 'stark', 'contrast', 'single', 'storey', 'roof', 'exist', 'step', 'roof', 'height', 'see', 'awkward', 'incongruous', 'addition', 'reflect', 'respect', 'exist', 'cause', 'substantial', 'harm', 'special', 'significance', 'conservation', 'state', 'harm', 'weigh', 'public', 'partial', 'raise', 'roof', 'sufficiently', 'offset', 'adverse', 'character', 'conservation', 'fail', 'preserve', 'enhance', 'character', 'appearance', 'conservation', 'duty', 'authority', 'stipulate', 'list', 'conservation', 'detrimental', 'character', 'aonb', 'aonb', 'management', 'partial', 'extend', 'roof', 'design', 'relationship', 'neighbour', 'properties', 'rise', 'overbear', 'occupiers', 'properties', 'significantly', 'diminish', 'unsatisy', 'outlook', 'addition', 'significant', 'overshadow', 'neighbour', 'properties', 'courtyard', 'poor', 'design', 'term', 'roof', 'shape', 'poor', 'relationship', 'neighbour', 'properties', 'give', 'rise', 'poor', 'level', 'amenity', 'substandard', 'live', 'environment', 'occupiers', 'fail', 'accord']","['partial', 'extend', 'roof', 'wholly', 'odds', 'see', 'stark', 'contrast', 'single', 'storey', 'roof', 'exist', 'step', 'roof', 'height', 'see', 'awkward', 'incongruous', 'addition', 'reflect', 'respect', 'exist', 'cause', 'substantial', 'harm', 'special', 'significance', 'conservation', 'state', 'harm', 'weigh', 'public', 'partial', 'raise', 'roof', 'sufficiently', 'offset', 'adverse', 'character', 'conservation', 'fail', 'preserve', 'enhance', 'character', 'appearance', 'conservation', 'duty', 'authority', 'stipulate', 'list', 'conservation', 'detrimental', 'character', 'aonb', 'aonb', 'management', 'partial', 'extend', 'roof', 'design', 'relationship', 'neighbour', 'properties', 'rise', 'overbear', 'occupiers', 'properties', 'significantly', 'diminish', 'unsatisy', 'outlook', 'addition', 'significant', 'overshadow', 'neighbour', 'properties', 'courtyard', 'poor', 'design', 'term', 'roof', 'shape', 'poor', 'relationship', 'neighbour', 'properties', 'give', 'rise', 'poor', 'level', 'amenity', 'substandard', 'live', 'environment', 'occupiers', 'fail', 'accord']",,,0.597671389579773,0.07621671259403229,,,,,0.21237435936927795,,,

The application site is not an allocated site for residential development and nor does not constitute windfall development, rounding-off of a settlement, infill development or fall within the exceptions for residential development in the countryside under Policy 7. Planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. The development would bring forward significant benefits including the provision of housing, with much needed affordable homes, economic benefits, the link road and its associated benefits. However, given the presence of a five-year housing supply and up to date Development Plan, there is no overriding requirement or justification that these benefits should be delivered on this particular site in advance of allocation within a neighbourhood plan, particularly given the harm that this proposal would cause to the environment as detailed in reason 2 below. The proposed development is contrary to Policies 1, 3 and 7 and of the Cornwall Local Plan; the aims and intentions of paragraphs of paragraphs 2, 12, and 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework; and the long standing fundamental of the UK planning system namely utilising a plan led approach to development 2 The northern housing site and link road would intrude into the open countryside harming the distinctive landscape character and visual amenity of the area. The A39 currently forms a strong edge limiting the spread of the built-up area of the settlement. The development breaches this clearly defined edge. The northern housing site would relate to Bodieve Village rather than Wadebridge and viewed in that context, would be significant in its scale. This harm is not outweighed by the benefits of the proposal in its submitted form and is therefore considered contrary to Policies 2, 7 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan and saved policy ENV1 and the aims and intentions of paragraphs 127 and 170 of the National Planning Policy Framework. 3 In the absence of a mechanism to secure the long-term provision of affordable housing, open space, educational infrastructure, primary care contributions for which there is evidence of an identified need, and on and off-site highways works, the proposal is considered to be contrary to the CC Document - Guidance on s106 Planning Obligations for Education Provision (April 2012), a guide to planning contributions and health care provision in relation to primary care premises, and Cornwall Local Plan Policies 8, 13, 16, 27, and 28; and paragraphs 8, 62, 91, 94, 96, 102, 103, 108 and 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework. 4 The application fails the statutory derogation tests as it would introduce a disturbance to foraging and commuting bats and there is no imperative reason of overriding public interest for the development.

This route, on the section between site and pub, includes requirement for pedestrians to cross a bridge which in narrow in width and provides no place for refuge. An alternative and longer route is provided for pedestrians via a pavement proposed along the front of the site, dismantled railway, Camel Trail and pub but this route is much more convoluted, longer in distance and less desirable. This scheme would create a desire line for pedestrians that is not suitable and safe for all users, including those with mobility constraints such as wheelchairs and pushchairs, which is contrary to Policy 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan and paragraph 108 of the National Planning Policy Framework. 2 The application site is divorced from any settlement in a location with poor accessibility to necessary daily services and facilities.  Occupiers of the new homes would therefore be heavily reliant on accessing services and facilities by private car, particularly having regard to the unsafe pedestrian route along the A389 where there is no continuous pavement. This conflicts with the objectives of enhancing active travel patterns, improving access to public transport, and encouraging a modal shift away from private motor vehicles in the interests of reducing resource consumption, air quality improvement and maintaining highway safety conditions. In the absence of any special circumstances to justify residential development in this countryside location, the proposal is not sustainable development and is contrary to Policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 12, 16 and 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan and the aims and intentions of paragraphs 8, 91, 102, 103, 108, 110, 127, 148 and 150 of the National Planning Policy Framework. 3 The proposed introduction of two new homes and associated infrastructure on undeveloped land will harm the distinctive natural character of a site within an Area of Great Landscape Value that is prominent to public view from users of the nearby A389 at a gateway location to a Main Town.

1660,1850,PA20/03691,Outline planning for a two storey dwelling with all matters except access reserved,04/05/2020," 1 The proposed development would increase the amount of vehicular traffic accessing and egressing the site, which due to limited visibility for drivers would require dangerous manoeuvres into or from the highway. The proposed development fails therefore to provide a safe and suitable access. Whilst this could be overcome through a revised access arrangement; this would necessitate the removal of a section of an historic wall on the western boundary of the site. This would result in a compromise to the wall which is considered to represent a non-designated heritage asset. The wall appears on historic mapping, and is one of a number of wall features that are referenced as enclosures within the Poughill Conservation Area Management Plan 2010. The wall arrangement functions as a clear distinction, narrowing from the newer development to the north of the settlement, down into the historic core of Poughill.
