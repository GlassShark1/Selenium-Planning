It would  also provide a poor standard of amenity  for future residents of the building.  By reason of its two storey  scale and design and use of materials the proposed development would cause  material  harm  to the designated  and undesignated  historic asset.  The development would  be an incongruous  and contrived  addition  to the street scene in this location and would  clearly  not add to the overall quality of the area and would not sufficiently integrate with the historic environment of this part of Illogan Churchtown.  It is considered that whilst less than substantial harm, the setting of surrounding heritage  assets,  including  the Listed buildings will be harmed by a proposal  of such poor design and scale in this prominent location.

Future occupants  of the proposed dwelling would be reliant upon the private vehicle to access services,  goods, facilities and employment given the distance to the nearest  settlements. The proposed development would create  additional  built form leading  to the incremental growth of buildings and domestic paraphernalia  into the open countryside to the detriment of the character of the area. This is especially the case at this site which is located within an Area of Outstanding Natural  Beauty and is in conflict with MD5 and MD9 of the Cornwall AONB Management Plan 2016-2021.

Due to the topography of the area, surface water  run off originating from higher  land is directed towards  the proposed site and existing dwellings.

Based on this, the LLFA questions the EA surface water mapping predictions as it would  appear that flooding occurs during lesser events than the 1 in 1000 year prediction.  The Flood Risk Assessment provided to support this application has investigated the flooding issues  and mitigation  measures have been suggested. These measures could aid in the management  of existing surface  water run off flows and so provide some betterment on the current  situation.  However,  betterment is proposed by mitigation  works on third party land and the owners  of this land have objected to the proposed  development  and submitted representations that they would  not allow drainage works on their properties.   The sequential  test has been undertaken and the proposal  would  fail this as there are sites in the parish that could  accommodate this scale of housing  that would  not result in the flooding issues which have been evidenced.

The application site is not an allocated site for development,  does not constitute  windfall under Policy 3 nor the exceptions for residential development in the countryside under Policy  7, has not demonstrably passed the sequential test pursuant to Policy 4, nor the provisions of Policy  5 1. a) - d) and 4. in respect to employment land.  The scale of the proposed  development is so substantial  that it is considered that the granting of permission would  prejudice  the community-led Neighbourhood Plan process by determining decisions about the scale and location of new development around the town. Planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate  otherwise.  In this case the material  considerations  in respect  to accessibility  and landscape impacts are such that a departure from the development plan is not justified at this time particularly as the Council  is able to demonstrate an up to date development plan based on a 5 year land supply position (as required by the NPPF) and in addition  this is supported by delivery rates, consents  and completions for the town which demonstrate  that the local plan targets will be met. The proposed development  is contrary to Policy 1, 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the adopted Cornwall  Local Plan and guidance  contained within  paragraphs 2, 12, 15, 86, 90 of the National Planning Policy Framework and the long standing fundamental of the UK planning system  namely utilising a plan led approach  to development. 2 Due to the failure to demonstrate safe, suitable  and desirable  pedestrian and cycle movements from the site to Wadebridge across the A39, it is considered that residents and those working at the site would  be likely to rely unduly on the use of private motor vehicles to access  the services and facilities. This would be in conflict  with the social  role of sustainability,  as well as the environmental role, which seeks to move to a low carbon economy and less reliance on the private  motor vehicle.  There is considered to be limited physical or functional  relationship with any established settlement and whilst  other  uses have been incorporated into the scheme there are no delivery mechanisms  for such uses, which unless the wider masterplan area is delivered are unlikely  to come forward  sufficient to aid internalisation  of trips for new residents  and existing residents  of Bodieve. It is considered therefore that the development is not sustainable and contrary to Policies  2, 3, 5 and 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan, the aims and intentions of paragraphs 8, 91, 102, 103, 108, 110 and 127 of the National  Planning Policy Framework and guidance  on accessibility limits  in Manual for Streets 1 and 2 (DETR). 3 The site relates to the open countryside and is significant  in terms of both landscape character,  visual  amenity and also has a high value  in creating  the natural extent of the visual setting of Wadebridge and is productive agricultural  land.  The A39 currently forms a strong edge limiting  the spread  of the built up DATED:  31 January  2019 Louise  Wood  -   Service Director Planning and Sustainable Developmentarea of the settlement.  This site breaches this clearly defined edge and much  of it is prominent in the surrounding landscape. Development  within the southerly parcel will be highly visible, lack any settlement context and would  erode the separation between Bodieve and Wadebridge.  This  harm is not outweighed  by the benefits of the proposal in its submitted form and is therefore  considered contrary to Policies  2 and 23 of the Cornwall  Local Plan and saved policy  ENV1  and the aims and intentions of paragraphs 127 and 170 of the National  Planning Policy Framework. 4 In the absence of a mechanism  to secure the long-term provision of affordable housing, open space, educational  infrastructure, air-quality mitigation for which there is evidence of an identified need, and on and off-site highways works, the proposal is considered to be contrary  to paragraphs 8, 62, 91, 94, 96, 102, 103, 105, 108, 127, 181 of the NPPF, and CC Document - Guidance on s106 Planning Obligations for Education Provision  (April 2012) and Cornwall Local Plan Policies 8, 13, 16, 27, and 28.",,REFUSAL,pdf,PA18_05209-REOUTZ_-_REFUSAL_NOTICE-4294952.pdf,Refused,2019-01-01,2019-06-30,,Smallscale Major Dwellings

The scale of the proposed development is so substantial that it is considered that the granting of permission would  prejudice  the community-led Neighbourhood Plan process by determining decisions about the scale and location of new development around the town.

The applicant has failed to secure  appropriate mitigation for deliverable improvements within the transport network within the foreseeable future in advance of the likely timeframe of the proposal being  occupied.  The resultant residual congestion is considered  to be severe  for the purposes of the NPPF and which would severely inconvenience road users and have associated environmental impacts.

The proposal is thus considered unsustainable  and contrary to policy 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan (2010-2030) and paragraphs  84, 108 and 109 of the NPPF (2019) in that it fails to demonstrate that safe and suitable access for all people  and that it would not cause a significantly  adverse impact  on the local road network that could be managed or mitigated. It would conflict with policies GD1 (e), OS7 and T1 (c) of the St Ives Neighbourhood Plan (2015-2030) in that it would adversely affect an existing Right of Way/footpath  and with paragraph 110 of the NPPF (2019)  in that it does not give priority to pedestrian movements, address the needs of people with disabilities, minimise  the scope for conflict  with pedestrians and vehicles  or allow for the efficient delivery  of goods and access by service and emergency  vehicles. It would also conflict  with policy  RA4 of the Cornwall AONB  Management  Plan (2016-2021)  in that it would  negatively impact on the accessibility of the Right of Way network  within the AONB. 2 Policy 5 (1) (c) of the Cornwall Local Plan  allows for proposals for new employment land and uses in the countryside  where they are of a scale appropriate to their location or demonstrate  an overriding locational and business need to be in that location such as farm diversification.  The existing  property consists of a number of disused semi-derelict  buildings  that do not form part of any active  farming enterprise and no supporting  evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed business venture  could  not be more sustainably accommodated elsewhere  within  the locality, particularly in the nearby  urban  area of St Ives. The proposal therefore  fails to accord with policy 5 and also policies 2 and 21 of the aforementioned Cornwall Local Plan, with policy MD15 of the Cornwall AONB Management  Plan (2016-2011) and with paragraphs 8 and 83 of the NPPF (2019).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          3 The applicant has submitted a Structural survey/report that advises in respect of proposed residential accommodation  (annotated  'kitchenette' on proposed site plan (ref:16023/13 Rev B)) that the building is very overgrown  and access  to it is limited and where visible its stone  walls are generally in a very poor condition.  In respect of the adjoining building (annotated  'managers living accommodation') on the aforementioned drawing the structural report gives no details as to the condition of that building.  Having regard to the lack of information in the structural report in respect of these clearly dilapidated structures it is considered that it has not been adequately demonstrated  they are capable  of conversion without extensive  rebuilding. The proposal  thus conflicts with policy 7 of the Cornwall Local Plan (2010-2030) which allows for the re-use of suitably constructed redundant buildings for residential purposes  that are considered appropriate to retain.  The preamble to policy  7 advises that the appropriateness of buildings for conversion  will depend on their structural  soundness and the IDOX/ability to convert  the building without  the necessity of substantial demolition  or substantial rebuilding operations. 4 The design and scale of the development, particularly  in respect of the increased/extended roof form and light spill, is such that it would  significantly increase the prominence/presence  of the site in the public domain  to the detriment of the character and sensitivity  of the wider rural landscape, which is a designated Area of Outstanding  Natural Beauty  (AONB). The proposal  would  as such fail to promote local distinctiveness  or conserve and enhance the wider setting of the site or the designated landscape and would  not accord  with policies 2, 12, 21 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan (2010-2030), with policies GD1 (b), BE10 and OS1 of the St Ives Neighbourhood Plan (2015-2030), with policies  CC7, MD9 and MD15  of the Cornwall  AONB Management Plan (2016-2021) or with paragraphs 79, 127, 170 and 172 of the NPPF (2019).",,REFUSAL,pdf,PA19_07027-REFULZ_-_REFUSAL_NOTICE-4666968.pdf,Refused,2019-07-01,2019-12-31,,

The proposal therefore represents  an unsustainable  intrusion  of sporadic housing development  into the open countryside, in a location which will not encourage sustainable modes of travel, with future occupiers likely to be highly dependent  on a private  motor  vehicle. Additionally,  the introduction of a new dwelling will further erode the prevailing rural character  of the area. In the absence of any special circumstances  to justify residential  development in this context, the proposal therefore raises direct conflict  with policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies  2010 - 2030,  policies H1 and D1 of the Feock  Neighbourhood Development Plan 2017 - 2030 and paragraphs 8, 79, 127 and 170 of the National Planning  Policy  Framework  2019. 2 The application does not demonstrate that a safe and suitable  means  of access  can be achieved to serve the site, with insufficient visibility demonstrated.  This is of particular concern  given the increase in vehicular movements to and from the site that can reasonably  be expected to result from the development. The application is therefore  contrary to policy  27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic  Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraph 108 of the National  Planning Policy Framework 2019. 3 The development  relates to a site partially within Flood  Zone 2, and wholly within  an area identified  on Council  mapping  as susceptible  to surface water flooding; Planning Practice Guidance and the National  Planning Policy  Framework  2019 advise that a site-specific  flood risk assessment is required for developments  in such areas. In this case, an appropriate flood risk assessment has not been provided. As such, it has not been demonstrated  that the development, which will introduce a more vulnerable use, is suitably safe from flood risk; neither  has it been demonstrated the development would  not impact  upon flood risk elsewhere. The proposal  is therefore considered contrary  to policy  26 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies  2010 - 2030, policy SC1 of the Feock Neighbourhood Development  Plan 2017 - 2030 and paragraphs 155, 163 and 164 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",,REFUSAL,pdf,PA19_06832-REFULZ_-_REFUSAL_NOTICE-4741153.pdf,Refused,2019-07-01,2019-12-31,,Minor - Dwelling

The site is not allocated for residential development via a made  Neighbourhood  Plan, is not previously developed land and does not represent infill or rounding off development. In the absence of evidenced need for affordable housing in this location, the site is not supported as a rural exceptions site for affordable housing. The proposal  therefore represents an undesirable and sporadic  form of residential development in the countryside which  would  result in harm to the intrinsic character and beauty of the surrounding Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.   In the absence  of any other  material considerations which  outweigh such harm,  the proposal is contrary  to Policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 21 and 23 of the Cornwall  Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030, paragraphs  79, 127, 170 and 172 of the National  Planning Policy Framework 2019 and policy MD9 of the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Management Plan 2016-2021. 2 Insufficient information has been submitted to enable an assessment of the impact on the proposal on the setting  of the Botallack and Truthwall Conservation Area and the Outstanding Universal  Value  of the St Just Mining  District World  Heritage Site.

In this case, the application site is not considered  to comply with planning policies concerning new windfall residential development  in this area, and is therefore  considered to be situated in the countryside as opposed  to within the Pool urban area. Furthermore, the site is considered to relate more closely in a physical  and visual sense to the surrounding  countryside rather than the urban area. The proposal is therefore considered to conflict with the aims and intentions  of policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall  Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030; Policy 1 of the Cornwall Site Allocations  Development  Plan Document;  and paragraphs 8, 127 and 170 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019. 2 The application site occupies a prominent position in the local landscape, in-particular when  approaching from Whitcross  Hill to the north-west,  and provides  a pleasant transition from urban to rural as one leaves the Pool urban area. A development of the site is considered to erode  the prominent, natural backcloth provided to the urban  area by the site, in turn failing  to recognise and respect the character, sensitivity and capacity of the landscape  asset, as informed by the 'Redruth, Camborne  and Gwennap' Landscape  Character Area Assessment and the 'Carnmenellis' Area of Great  Landscape Value. The proposal is therefore considered to conflict with the aims and intentions  of policies 1, 2 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies  2010 - 2030, and paragraphs  8, 127 and 170 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019. 3 By reason of the site's positioning within the direct  setting of, and in-between, prominent listed buildings and non-designated heritage  assets which are synonymous with the area's mining heritage  and which contribute to the Outstanding Universal Value of the Camborne  and Redruth Mining District  World Heritage Site, the proposal  is considered to erode  the appreciation  and understanding of the assets, and to in turn fail to preserve the listed buildings  and their setting and the authenticity  and integrity of the Outstanding Universal Value of the World Heritage Site. Furthermore, the submitted  Heritage Assessment has failed to demonstrate otherwise. Whilst the harm to the heritage assets would be less then substantial,  the public benefits of the proposal in terms of the provision of additional  residential units in an area with low strategic  demand is not considered to outweigh  this harm. The proposal  is therefore considered to conflict with the aims and intentions  of S66(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990;  policies 1, 2 and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies  2010 - 2030;  and paragraphs 184, 192, 193, 194 and 196 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019. 4 In the absence of sufficient ecological assessment of the application  site where there is considered to be reasonable  likelihood of protected species  being  present, it has not been demonstrated  that the proposal  would  at least conserve and protect, let alone  enhance, the biodiversity  interests of the site.

It is considered that the application would  increase the risk of flooding elsewhere if built and that the extension would  itself be at risk from flooding.  This is a material  consideration which is sufficient to warrant refusal of the application on the basis that it has the potential to cause harm to increase the risk of flooding, thereby causing harm to both neighbouring residents  and occupiers of 22 Rivendell.

The larger green gaps along Red Lane are considered to add significantly to its character and to allow a residential development of the site and the removal of a significant  section of the existing Cornish hedge boundary to form the new access  and associated visibility splay requirements and access track would represent further, incremental  urbanisation of a pleasant, rural lane, thereby unacceptably  harming the character and setting of Rosudgeon  and Perran  Downs and the surrounding countryside in conflict with the aims and intentions of policies 1,  2, 3, 7, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030; and paragraphs 8, 127 and 170 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019. 2 The land was in use by a person/persons  with mining connections  and that as such would be regarded  as a mineworker's smallholding, of which this area has many. As such,  the field would be regarded  as an attribute that expresses the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) of the World  Heritage  Site. It is acknowledged that the southern  field boundary has been lost, but the site and wider environs still retain an open and undeveloped rural character. The proposed development,  that would  be readily visible from the road to the north  east and north  west,  is considered to erode  some of that character which would  neither conserve nor enhance the remaining legibility of this historic land-use contrary to Policy  24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies and paragraph 184 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",,REFUSAL,pdf,PA20_03479-REFULZ_-_REFUSAL_NOTICE-5205412.pdf,Refused,2020-07-01,2020-09-30,,Minor - Dwelling

This conflicts with the aim of conserving and enhancing the landscape and scenic  beauty of this designation  that carries the highest status of protection,  to which great weight  is accorded as a material planning consideration. This submitted  scheme does not meet a specific need for housing in the countryside  and is not judged to be infilling  or rounding off an existing settlement, conflicting with Policies 1, 3, 7, 9 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic  Policies 2010 - 2030;  saved policy  ENV1 of the North Cornwall District Local Plan; and guidance contained within  the NPPF(2019). 2 The submitted scheme does not demonstrate safe access/egress for each proposed property  within  the scheme onto the C57 Treyarnon Lane, nor from the junction of the C57 Treyarnon Lane onto the B3276, which in the opinion of the Local Planning  Authority could give rise to conflict  with other  users  of the highway. The location  of this site is likely to encourage pedestrians  to use the B3276 which is a rural lane with no pavements.  The proposed  footpath diversion  route is assessed to be unlikely  to address day to day needs  for residents of the application site, and overall it is assessed  that the development will encourage  short journeys by private car.  The proposed location of this development would encourage pedestrians  and cycle movement in conflict with motorised traffic giving rise to increase  danger for all users and creating an unacceptable  highway  safety impact. As such the development  is assessed to conflict  with Policies  16 and 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies  2010-2030.",,REFUSAL,pdf,PA20_03309-REOUTZ_-_REFUSAL_NOTICE-5152854.pdf,Refused,2020-07-01,2020-09-30,,Minor - Dwelling

The site's location and scale of development  does not constitute infill development or rounding off nor utilise previously developed  land and the site is not allocated for residential development  in the Landulph Neighbourhood Development  Plan 2018-2030.   The settlement  is considered suitable for housing on a rural exceptions basis where housing development is responsive to local circumstances  in reflecting local housing  needs and be affordable housing led.  However  the scheme  is not considered to be a suitable rural exceptions development  as the scale of the development and the number of dwellings proposed  in relation to the very low evidence of identified housing need in the Parish goes beyond  what is considered appropriate.   Furthermore, the submitted information has not demonstrated  that the level of market housing  proposed is essential for the successful delivery of the scheme.  The scheme  also fails to demonstrate that the proposed affordable housing meets the Nationally Described Space Standards and that 25% of the affordable units will comprise accessible homes.  The positioning of the affordable  dwellings across  the site, together with the limited garden spaces  serving  a number  of the affordable units will also fail to create a scheme where the affordable units are indistinguishable from the open market  dwellings, which in contrast comprise large, detached properties (generally) sited in the southern half of the plot, benefiting from generous garden spaces  and garaging.   The proposal is therefore  not considered to constitute sustainable  development  as defined  by the Development  Plan as it conflicts specifically with Policies  1, 3, 9 and 13 of the Cornwall  Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, adopted  November 2016; Cornwall Council Housing Supplementary Planning Document  2020 and guidance within paragraphs  8, 11, 15 and 77 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019. 2 The proposal, by reason of its scale,  density, layout and location,  fails to conserve or enhance the landscape and scenic beauty of the Tamar Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty  (AONB).  The proposed development represents major development within the AONB without sufficient evidence of exceptional circumstances and that the development is in the public interest.  The development as proposed  would erode the special qualities and features in this part of the AONB and is therefore contrary to Policy 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan, paragraph 172 of the National Planning Policy  Framework 2019 and the Tamar Valley AONB  Management  Plan 2019-2024. 3 In the absence of a mechanism  to secure the provision  of affordable housing;  public open space on site including  future management and maintenance in perpetuity; offsite financial contributions towards  educational infrastructure and off-site financial contributions to manage the increased recreational impacts on IDOX/the Plymouth  Sound and Estuaries SAC Natura 2000 site the proposal  is contrary to Policies  1, 2, 9, 12, 13, 16, 22, 23, 25 and 28 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and CC Guidance on S106 Planning Obligations for Education Provision 2018.

The site parameters are extremely constrained with vehicle  and pedestrian access passing the living quarters of the neighbouring  property which  immediately  adjoins the access. The proposed parking provisions  would not allow sufficient space  for the parking and turning of occupants and visitor's vehicles leaving,  resulting in vehicles  having to reverse in excess of 60 metres  along a shared private  access road. The intensified residential  use would  result in an increase in the number of vehicle  movements and pedestrian activity along this road harming the living  conditions of the occupiers  of neighbouring  properties with particular reference to No. 32 Cove View. The proposal  would therefore  conflict  with policy  SD2 of the Hayle  Neighbourhood Plan 2014 - 2030, policies 2, 12 and 13 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 127, 170 and 180 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 which  together seek to provide adequate parking; protect individuals and property  from unreasonable  noise and disturbance by creating places with appropriate  densities  which are safe, inclusive and accessible; and promote  health and well-being with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users. 2 The proposed development includes  an extension of the hard standing situated within the rear garden  to accommodate an increased number  of vehicles using the site. Due to the sloping  topography, the enlarged parking area and parked vehicles would be elevated above the wide stretch of incredibly scenic open coastline to the north-west of the site appearing extremely  prominent from the public right of way route code 102/29/4 which is positioned  on land below and to the rear of the development  site. The rear gardens  serving  the dwellings along Riviere Towans  are characterised by their long and unobstructed  rear gardens  which provide panoramic views over the coastline  below. The inclusion of the low hedge which attempts to conceal the harmful  urban appearance of the enlarged vehicle parking  area would adversely impact the openness  of this garden,  appearing at odds with the prevailing landscape character. The proposed development would therefore  fail to respond positively to its setting,  adversely  impacting the character  and appearance of this attractive landscape in conflict with policies  SD2 and NE3 of the Hayle Neighbourhood  Development  Plan 2014 - 2030, policies 1, 2, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 8, 127 and 170 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",,REFUSAL,pdf,PA20_02517-REFULZ_-_REFUSAL_NOTICE-5150287.pdf,Refused,2020-07-01,2020-09-30,,Householder

In the absence of a sequential test, it has not been demonstrated on the reasonable availability of other sites suitable for the development which are located within an area at a lower risk of flooding. As a consequence, the location of the site is not acceptable in terms of the risk of flooding, with particular regard to the sequential test. It therefore conflicts with Policies 2, 16 and 26 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 which collectively seek to protect people from unsafe environments and potential hazards, ensure that buildings can adapt and be resilient to climate change and require development to be sited in a manner that increases flood resilience of the area, taking account of the need to avoid areas of flood risk.",,REFUSAL,pdf,NOT COLLECTED,Refused,2022-01-01,2022-03-31,,Minor - Dwelling

In this case the harm of the proposed Juliet balconies and associated works has been set out above. Although the private benefits and minor economic benefits of the insertion of Juliet balconies are appreciated, the proposed works would result in less than substantial harm in relation to the Conservation Area and its setting that are not balanced by these factors or other factors acting in the public interest.The proposal is therefore contrary to the aims and intentions of Policies 2 (paragraphs 1a to 1d), 12 (paragraphs 1a and 1b), 23 (paragraphs 2 , 2a and 2b) and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 (Adopted 22nd November 2016); Sections 1, 2.6, 2.9, 2.10 and 7.8 of the Cornwall Design Guide 2013; and paragraphs 126, 130, 134, 194, 197(c), 199, 202, 176, 178 and 189 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. The proposed development does not accord with the local planning authority's statutory duty under section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 because it would not preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. 2 The proposed Juliet balconies, due to their design and location, would result in an unacceptable increase in overlooking and disturbance in relation to the immediately adjacent garden area of 17 Boscaswell Village. The extremely close proximity of the proposed Juliet balconies allows for a significant increase in levels of overlooking and disturbance to the users of 17 Boscaswell Village that is considered intrusive, unreasonable and of harm beyond that of the reasonable levels of privacy currently enjoyed at this property. The proposed Juliet balconies would raise concerns relating to the impact upon the occupiers of neighbouring property that are not balanced by other factors acting in the public interest.The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 12 paragraphs 2a and 2c of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 (Adopted 22nd November 2016); Section 2.6 (bullet point 1); Section 4.1 (bullet point 1) and Section 4.11 (bullet point 1) of the Cornwall Design Guide 2013; and paragraphs 126, 130, 132 and 134 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021",,REFUSAL,pdf,NOT COLLECTED,Refused,2022-01-01,2022-03-31,,Householder

The main northwest elevation bank of sunroom windows currently allows for a largely unhindered open outlook, with the subject two storey extension proposed to directly face the sunroom windows, and at close proximity. The currently unhindered open outlook would be replaced with a two storey blank wall and roof, with the resulting impact being regarded as detrimental to the users of the property.

The proposed development would introduce a new unrestricted residential dwelling into the open countryside for which there are no special circumstances or justification. The dwelling would not be in a sustainable location, having particular regard to the lack of accessibility to services and facilities available locally and would give rise to dependence of future occupants on the private motor vehicle in terms of accessing such services and facilities. The proposed development would increase the urban built form and density of development on the edge of the highway within this sensitive location. The proposed increase in the urban form would neither maintain the character and distinctive landscape qualities of the Area of Great Landscape Value. Furthermore, due to the confined nature of the site, the proposal would remove the existing amenity space allocated to the neighbouring property known as Heathlands and due to the close proximity of the site to the south-east elevation of the property, the proposal would result in a poor residential environment for the occupants of Heathlands.

Furthermore, it is considered that an improved scheme of planting along the boundaries would unlikely overcome any harm - indeed, the substantial shading caused by the existing trees upon the proposed dwellings and their outside areas, coupled with the likely desire to achieve countryside views from the dwellings, is likely to increase the pressure for their felling following occupation (despite any tree protection conditions), thereby making the development even more conspicuous, including in the setting of Bosavern House.

New build development in the countryside is strictly controlled though there is some limited policy support for new sustainable business proposals. Specifically, policy 5 of the Cornwall Local Plan (2010-2030) supports employment land and uses in the countryside where the scale of development is appropriate to its location or demonstrates an overriding locational and business need to be in that location or an extension to an existing business where re-location would be impractical or not viable. Policy EX1 of the Hayle Neighbourhood Plan (2014-2030) supports proposals where the development demands a countryside location and paragraph 84 of the NPPF (2021) advises that planning decisions should enable the sustainable growth and expansion of all types of business in rural areas both through the conversion of existing buildings and well-designed new buildings. The applicant has not provided any information to demonstrate a business need for the proposed building to be sited at this rural location, nor any justification for the scale or internal layout of the development. Further to the above, the design of the proposed building is not locally distinctive, is not well related spatially to the existing development on-site and would constitute a prominent, discordant feature in the street scene that would not conserve or enhance the character of the wider open countryside.

The proposed development fails to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Mousehole Conservation Area or enhance the landscape character and natural beauty of the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty in conflict with Section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Policies 1, 2, 12, 23 and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, paragraphs 8, 130, 174, 176 and Section 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and Policy MD9 of the Cornwall AONB Management Plan 2016-2021. 3 The existing access onto Mousehole Lane which is proposed to serve the new dwelling has constrained emerging visibility in both directions. An emerging car would be unable to observe approaching road users due to the boundary walls both side of the access, therefore leaving road users vulnerable to collision. The proposed development is therefore not considered to be served by a safe and suitable access in conflict with Policy 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraph 110 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",,REFUSAL,pdf,NOT COLLECTED,Refused,2022-01-01,2022-03-31,,Minor - Dwelling

It is not considered that the need and benefits of the development clearly outweigh this harm. In addition, notwithstanding the submitted DEFRA Metric 3.0 computation and its inclusion of a nearby biodiversity offsetting area, the proposal fails to properly account for the loss of the wet woodland/marshy grassland priority habitat on site. Furthermore, it fails to deploy the mitigation hierarchy as required, and to specify an acceptable offsetting mechanism.

As a result this proposal goes beyond the scope of Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and is contrary to guidance within the National Planning Practice Guidance, specifically paragraphs 001 Reference ID: 17a-001-20140306 (Revision date: 06 03 2014) and 031 Reference ID: 21a-031-20180615 (Revision date: 15 06 2018). 2 The amended development proposed by this application to vary condition 2 and remove condition 11 of permission PA20/03591 dated 2nd December 2020 would result in an increase in the amount of vehicular traffic accessing and egressing to and from the site over the U6168/C68 priority T-junction which based on observed road speeds is substandard due to its limited emerging visibility for drivers exiting the junction and limited forward visibility for drivers approaching the junction from the south, which would contribute to an increased risk of collision and reduction in highway safety to both occupants and members of the public. The proposed application therefore, fails to provide safe and suitable access compared with the access arrangement approved and secured by condition 10 of permission PA20/03591, the proposed amended access arrangement is considered to materially diminish the quality of permission PA20/03591 by virtue of the reduced visibility splays at the proposed site access and the increased loss of hedgerow that will occur to provide visibility improvement and splays that will be detrimental to the character and appearance of the streetscene. The application and is contrary to Policies 1, 2, 12, 23 and 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 (adopted November 2016) and paragraphs 104 - 112, 130, 131 and 135 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 3 In the absence of appropriate evidence, the proposal fails to adequately demonstrate how the proposed works to the existing hedgerows to create visibility splays would impact upon any species protected by law both during and post implementation of the proposed scheme, existing trees in or adjacent to hedgerow works. In the absence of such information the Local Planning Authority is unable to assess whether adverse harm would be generated with respect to any protected species or existing trees. Hence the development is contrary to the aims of paragraphs 179-180 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, guidance within the section titled 'Natural environment' of Planning Practice Guidance, together with Policies 1, 2, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030.",,REFUSAL,pdf,NOT COLLECTED,Refused,2022-04-01,2022-06-30,,Minor - Dwelling

The necessary vehicular access to the site is extremely constrained due to the lack of visibility of oncoming traffic when egressing onto the Class C highway. The proposal has therefore failed to demonstrate that safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users, and in view of the proposed intensification of the use of the site by vehicles, the proposed development would result in an unacceptable impact on existing levels of highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 110 and 112 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.

Accordingly, the proposed extension would read as an incongruous, tacked-on feature that would fail to respect the modest form and character of the rural building and would appear as a prominent addition, and thus it would change so much that its existing character would have less relevance and the altered main building would be subservient to the extension. For these reasons, the proposed development would harm the character and appearance of the modest, traditional rural building contrary to Policy 7 and 12 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and Paragraph 81 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 Policy 23 along with para 2.34 of the supporting text to Policy 7 refers to traditional vernacular buildings as part of the defining character of the Cornish countryside. The subject building is considered to be a traditional vernacular building and worthy of retention. The addition of an incongruous, tacked-on feature is unsympathetic to the local character and history of the surrounding rural environment.For these reasons the proposal conflicts with Policy 7 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 along with paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 3 In the absence of a mechanism to secure the provision of financial contributions to mitigate the recreation impact on the Fal and Helford Special Area of Conservation for which there is evidence of an identified need, the proposal is considered to be contrary to policies 22 of the Cornwall Local Plan.",,REFUSAL,pdf,NOT COLLECTED,Refused,2022-04-01,2022-06-30,,Minor - Dwelling

The proposed works materially reduce the visual quality of an iconic streetscape, and fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Penzance Conservation Area; the contribution of the host building that is afforded Group Value; and the setting of the adjacent Grade II listed building(s). The National Planning Policy Framework requires harm to be weighed against the public benefit of the proposals. In this case the harm of the proposed two storey extension has been set out above.  Although the private benefits and minor economic benefits of the extension are appreciated, the proposed works would result in less than substantial harm in relation to the Conservation Area and its setting that are not balanced by these factors or other factors acting in the public interest.The proposal is therefore contrary to the aims and intentions of Policies 1, 2 (paragraphs 1a to 1d), 12 (paragraphs 1a and 1b) and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 (Adopted 22nd November 2016); Sections 2 (paragraph 2.1.1), 3 (paragraphs 3.1.2, 3.2.2 and 3.3.5) and 5 (paragraph 5.8.1) of the Cornwall Design Guide 2021; and paragraphs 126, 130 (paragraphs a to d), 132, 134, 189, 197(c), 199, 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. The proposed development does not accord with the local planning authority's statutory duty under section 72 (1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 because it would not preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. 2 The proposed extension, due to its design, scale and location, results in a harmful increase in overbearing, loss of light and loss of outlook in relation to the first floor terrace and living room window of the immediately adjacent neighbouring property to the northwest (23 New St / Abbey Cottage)The proposed two storey rear extension would result in a loss of outlook and loss of light in relation to the living room window, and would further result in harmful overbearing, loss of outlook and loss of sunlight/ambient light to the existing terrace. The proposed works have a detrimental impact upon the main living area and associated terrace of 23 New St / Abbey Cottage, that are currently enjoyed by users of these properties.The proposed extension would raise concerns relating to the impact upon users of the neighbouring property that are not balanced by other factors acting in the public interest.The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 12 (paragraph 2b) of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 (Adopted 22nd November 2016); Section 9 of the Cornwall Design Guide 2021; and paragraphs 126, 130 and 132 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021",,REFUSAL,pdf,NOT COLLECTED,Refused,2022-07-01,2022-09-30,,Householder

In addition, with regard to the narrow plot character of the existing terrace, the scale of the extensions represent development which appears cramped and contrived failing to demonstrate a cultural, physical and aesthetic understanding of its location.

Additionally, the flat roof proposed in order to accommodate the parking space is considered to be an incongruous addition that would appear out of keeping with the surrounding area which is predominantly comprised of pitched tiled roofs. The development is therefore considered to be contrary to the aims and intensions of Policies SD5 of the Hayle Neighbourhood Development Plan, Policies 1, 2 and 12 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030, the Cornwall Design Guide 2021 and paragraphs 130 and 134 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The proposals result in an overbearing and intrusive form of development having an adverse effect by overshadowing and loss of outlook on neighbouring properties and resulting in poor standards of residential amenity.The height and form of proposed outbuilding, together with its massing and position directly adjacent to 10 Back Lane's northwestern boundary, is considered to create a strong sense of enclosure experienced by the occupants of 10 Back Lane. It is considered that the outbuilding would significantly reduce the levels of residential amenity enjoyed by the occupants of 10 Back Lane, with the outlook from both the garden and northeast facing ground floor habitable rooms severely impacted and resulting in unacceptable overbearing impacts. The scheme conflicts with Policy 12 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 which seek, amongst other matters, to ensure new development does not adversely affect the amenity of neighbouring properties. 3 In the absence of relevant assessments or detailed drawings, it is considered that none of the submitted written material is sufficient to demonstrate that the necessary site works would not cause an unacceptable risk to the retaining wall supporting the public highway. The National Planning Policy Framework in paragraph 174 makes it clear that new development will be expected, as a matter of national planning policy, not to put existing development at unacceptable risk from, nor adversely to affect it by, land instability. There is also insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the proposed outbuilding would be adequately supported to allow vehicles to park on the roof. In these circumstances the conclusion is that the proposal as submitted would be likely to result in material harm to the stability of land both on and in the immediate vicinity of the site, and in particular in relation to the retaining wall supporting the public highway.

The appearance of any new development on the site would be seen as a harmful encroachment into the surrounding countryside, to which it has a greater affinity than the adjoining urban form, and would result in a loss of its distinctive rural landscape character, which is subject to special protection through its designation within Camborne and Redruth Mining District World Heritage Site (WHS). Unjustified by any overriding public benefits, this sporadic form of new residential development would result in the loss of part of the relic landscape, which contributes positively to the Outstanding Universal Value and the significance of the WHS. Further environmental harm would result through the lack of suitable pedestrian infrastructure between the site and the nearest settlement, thereby giving rise to a likely increase in the reliance on the private motor vehicle, and hence unsustainable transport movements. Ultimately, the proposed use is not suitable for its location and represents an unsustainable form of residential development, in conflict with policy 1 of Cornwall Site Allocations Development Plan Document 2019, policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 12, 13, 21, 23 and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 8, 119, 124, 130, 174, 189, 197, 199 and 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The proposed development would introduce residential development, a new vulnerable use, on land that is within a Critical Drainage Area and in a location designated as an Area Susceptible to Surface Water Flooding where parts of the site and immediate access is identified by Cornwall Council's Strategic Flood Risk Assessment mapping to be at risk of 1 in 30 year and 1 in 100 year surface water flood events.

The introduction of a dwelling on this location would diminish this important gap and bring the built form further into the countryside, to the detriment of the landscape and visual amenities of the area and contrary to Policy 1 and 3 of the Cornwall Local Plan (Strategic Policies). 2 The site now proposed for an open market dwelling formed a part of a previous development approved as a rural exception scheme, where the land take for open market housing was already above 50% of the total site area. The application site must be considered in conjunction with the adjacent site to the southeast, given that, where the splitting of a site results in two sites which are physically adjoined and access shared, the capacity and suitability of the entire developable area will be considered for the purposes of determining whether it falls above or below affordable housing thresholds. In this case, in combination with the adjoining site to the southeast, the scheme further increases the land take for open market housing and exceeds the threshold for affordable housing contributions, based on floorspace, as indicated within policy 8 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030. In the absence of a mechanism to adequately secure the provision of the appropriate financial off-site contribution (in lieu of on-site provision) for affordable housing, the proposal is considered to be contrary to policies 6 and 8 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030. 3 The application site falls within the Zone of Influence of the Penhale Dunes Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and it is considered that the proposal would when considered in combination with other plans and projects, adversely affects the integrity of the SAC without the ability to mitigate.

The proposed development would introduce a new unrestricted residential dwelling into the open countryside for which there are no special circumstances or justification. The dwelling would not be in a sustainable location, having particular regard to the lack of accessibility to services and facilities available locally and would give rise to dependence of future occupants on the private motor vehicle in terms of accessing such services and facilities. The narrow linear form of the site does not demonstrate a cultural, physical and aesthetic understanding of its location. The provision of a dwelling with associated access, parking, garden with associated paraphernalia would, even if extensively landscaped and with a modest dwelling of an appropriate design, change the character of the site to a more domestic appearance and suburban appearance. As a consequence, the undeveloped verdant appearance, would be unduly eroded. Furthermore, the proposal would result in the subdivision of the long narrow plot that represents a historic example of the morphology of a mining settlement that is a key attribute that expressed the Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site.

Policy 7 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 sets out the special circumstances in which residential development within the open countryside will be considered acceptable. It has not been demonstrated that the building is suitably constructed for its intended residential use, nor is the building redundant, disused or a historic building that is considered appropriate to retain and would lead to an enhancement to the immediate setting. Furthermore, there is insufficient information to determine that the existing building and the proposed works would meet the requirement that the building is capable of being converted to a dwelling without substantial rebuilding operations. The application building is prominent when viewed from the road. The building reads as a simple and functional stable building that relates to the adjacent field and surrounding rural character of the area, the type of building which Is expected in a rural setting and as such does not appear out of place. The proposal works would give the building a new domestic character which would significantly alter the appearance of the building and its associated curtilage. The proposed development is not considered to lead to an enhancement to the immediate setting, which is open and rural, which would be eroded by the conversion works, associated domestic paraphernalia and subdivision of the open field to the north and east of the application building and as such would have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area. It is therefore concluded that the proposal would not accord with Policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraphs 8, 130 and 174 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",,REFUSAL,pdf,NOT COLLECTED,Refused,2022-07-01,2022-09-30,,Minor - Dwelling

Further, the proposed development would result in residential development and associated domestic paraphernalia encroaching upon the valley bottom which is identified as a key landscape characteristic by both permitted and emerging development proposals within the wider area and which facilitates green and blue infrastructure provision to support development within the area. These aspects are both key to achieving good design and sustainable development which creates better places in which to live and work and helps make development acceptable to communities.

Thus, the development conflicts with Development Plan policy concerning the location of new housing development.  The proposed development, by reason of its location beyond the development boundary, would incrementally extend the settlement into the countryside and result in the harmful urbanisation of an undeveloped site which contributes to the semi-rural character of the area and setting of the settlement. There is no further justification for market housing in this location to outweigh the environmental harm identified and the development is thereby contrary to policies HT1 and HT4 in the Crowan Neighbourhood Development Plan 2018- 2030, policies 2, 3, 7, 12, 21 and 23 in the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraphs 8, 130 and 174 in the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.   2 The site parameters are extremely constrained with a new vehicle and pedestrian access proposed immediately between and in close proximity to the two frontage properties known as Bellevue and Perivale.

The inclusion of the gable end and the encroachment of the development towards its north-east boundary, which is shared with the neighbouring dwelling known as Penlea, would result in a harmful loss of light and aspect enjoyed by the occupants and future occupants of Penlea, and adversely impact upon their residential amenity. The excessive width of the proposed building is accentuated by the monotonous appearance of the principal elevation, which lacks interest and contains overly symmetrical fenestration. Its cramped appearance is emphasised by its failure to successfully integrate the parking provision within the development, which results in its frontage being dominated by vehicle parking and thus fails to respond positively and enhance the local historical context and character.

The proposed design and layout of the units on the ground and first floor would result in a gloomy and oppressive living environment, thereby resulting in inadequate living conditions for future occupants. The units on the ground and first floor would not accord with the nationally described space standards the minimum gross internal floor areas. In addition, the proposed extension to the rear of the existing building, adjacent to the Trenwith Place, would be overbearing for the occupiers of Royal Cottages.

The limited benefits to the tourist economy do not outweigh the environmental harm due to the unsustainable location in terms of access, or the adverse visual impact to the rural and landscape character of the Lynher Valley Area of Great Landscape Value through the introduction of unsympathetically designed built development, erosion of the rural context and domestication of the land.

As such the proposed development is contrary to policies 1A and 1B of the Camelford Neighbourhood Development Plan 2020-2030. 2 The proposed development is within a rural location and would extend the built form of the settlement further out into the countryside. The proposal is not considered to be affordable housing led, as: the proposed size of the units and tenure fail to reflect the identified affordable housing need for the parish and insufficient financial viability information has been provided to demonstrate that the level of proposed open market dwellings is the minimum required to deliver the affordable housing on site. The proposal is therefore not considered to constitute Sustainable Development and would conflict with policy 1B of the Camelford Neighbourhood Development Plan 2020-2030; Policies 1, 2, 3 and 9 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, and guidance contained within paragraphs 100 - 104 of the Cornwall Housing Supplementary Planning Document 2020 and paragraphs 8 and 63 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021. 3 The application site is within the hydrological catchment of the River Camel which is designated as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitat Regulations 2017.

Consequently, the proposal is contrary to the aims and intentions of Policies 2 and 12 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, Policies DG 2 and DG 4 of the Falmouth Neighbourhood Development Plan 2012-2030, as well as advice contained in the Sections 4.2.5 and 9.5.7 of the Cornwall Design Guide 2021, and advice in paragraphs 8 and 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The outline proposal for the erection of a dwelling on this restricted site would be harmful to the residential amenities of adjoining occupiers with the inevitable scale and mass of the building, together with its proximity to the party boundary with the immediate neighbours at No. 19 Crossways, having a dominating and overbearing impact on neighbouring dwellings and private amenity spaces. The residential amenities of future occupiers of the development would also be severely compromised by the proximity, elevated and overbearing nature of the existing host dwelling set immediately to the north of the site. Such an arrangement of buildings would be contrary with the aims and intentions of Policy 12 (2) of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, as well as advice contained in the Section 9.5.7 of the Cornwall Design Guide 2021, and advice in paragraphs 8 and 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 3 In the absence of a mechanism to secure the provision of a financial contribution towards the Strategic Access Management and Monitoring Measures for the Fal and Helford Special Area of Conservation, for which there is evidence of an identified need, the proposal is considered to be contrary to Policies 22, 23 and 28 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, the European Sites Mitigation Supplementary Planning Document (July 2021), and advice in paragraphs 8, 55, 57, 174 and 180 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",,REFUSAL,pdf,NOT COLLECTED,Refused,2022-10-01,2022-12-31,,Minor - Dwelling

As such the application contains insufficient evidence and justification for the scheme to deliver no affordable housing. 2 The proposed development would involve the partial retention and conversion of the existing relatively modern utilitarian buildings which do not make a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the area. There is no overriding reason to retain any of the buildings within the application site. The retention and conversion of an existing building on the site would result in a contrived design giving rise to a poor standard of amenity for future occupiers and a poor site layout. In particular, units 14 - 20, due to the orientation, single aspect and lack of direct natural ventilation into living spaces would have inadequate living conditions for future occupants. The proposed parking layout, in respect of units 1 - 5 would give rise to pedestrian and vehicle conflict thereby failing to provide a safe and suitable access to the site for all people. Although each unit would have a small provision of private amenity space the areas between the dwellings would be laid to hardstanding used for car parking. This is not considered to be an enhancement on the current appearance of the site. The proposal has failed to improve the appearance of the site by including a site specific landscaping scheme. For the reasons outlined the proposal has failed to seize the opportunity to enhance or better reveal the significance of the designated heritage assets and their setting which is impacted upon by the proposed development.

The extant plot acts as a surviving record of the morphology of the historic mining settlement, which is a key attribute that expresses the Outstanding Universal Value of the Camborne and Redruth Mining District World Heritage Site (WHS) and makes a positive contribution to the significance of the WHS as a heritage asset. By developing the site as a separate residential unit, the plot would be severed from its historic functional relationship with the host dwelling, thereby eroding its historic character and overwriting the morphology of the historic plots to the detriment of their authenticity and legibility. The resulting harm to the significance of the WHS is graded as less than substantial, and such harm is neither wholly exceptional nor is it capable of being outweighed by any public benefit arising from the proposal.

In the absence of information to demonstrate otherwise, safe and suitable access to the development for all people is therefore not provided and the application is contrary to Policy 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraphs 110 and 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The proposed development would result in the substantial loss of an existing stone-faced hedgebank and associated mature Sycamore tree and landscape structure along the existing site roadside frontage on the south western side of Kenwyn Road, which is considered to contribute positively to the character and appearance of the Truro Conservation Area.

The proposal represents poor design in terms of resultant roof shape and the poor relationship between neighbouring properties gives rise to a poor level of amenity and substandard living environment for all occupiers.

Due to the constrained parameters of the parking area proposed to serve the existing and proposed dwellings, it would not be possible to safely park and turn four vehicles without egressing onto the adjoining carriageway in a reverse gear. When egressing onto the B3302 in a reverse gear, the visibility of oncoming traffic approaching from the south-east would be severely constrained by the presence of the neighbouring dwelling, thereby raising potential for vehicular conflict. Therefore, the development proposal fails to demonstrate that safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved by all vehicular users which results in conflict with policy 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraph 110 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.

The existing dwelling and those adjacent have evidential and historical value in that they are a tangible and legible representation of past lives and the activities within this section of the WHS, such that the existing dwelling is deemed to be a non-designated heritage asset which adds to the overall significance of the WHS being a designated heritage asset. The loss of the existing dwelling, which is an irreplaceable resource, would result in the loss of a non-designated heritage asset and less than substantial harm to the significance of the WHS. The resulting harm to the authenticity and integrity of the WHS is not wholly exceptional nor is it outweighed by any substantial public benefits. Furthermore, by reason of its form, footprint and design, the extension proposed to accommodate the new flats would fail to harmonise with the character and appearance of the existing terrace of historic cottages, thereby failing to promote local distinctiveness and respond positively to the landscape. In the absence of any other material considerations which outweigh the identified harm, the proposal is contrary to policies 1, 2, 12, 21, and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, paragraphs 8, 119, 130, 189, 197, 199 and 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and policies P3, C2 and C9 of The Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site Management Plan 2020-2025. 2 In the absence of sufficient technical information to support the application where there is considered to represent surface water flooding concerns, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would minimise, reduce or where possible eliminate flood risk on site and in the area.

It has not been demonstrated that the building is suitably constructed for its intended residential use, nor is the building redundant, disused or a historic building that is considered appropriate to retain and would lead to an enhancement to the immediate setting. Furthermore, there is insufficient information to determine that the existing building and the proposed works would meet the requirement that the building is capable of being converted to a dwelling without substantial rebuilding operations. The application building is prominent when viewed from the road. The building reads as a simple and functional agricultural building that relates to the adjacent field and surrounding rural character of the area, the type of building which Is expected in a rural setting and as such does not appear out of place.

The redevelopment of the land for housing is likely to result in the future pressure to develop the adjoining area of open countryside to the north-east, which is borne out by the unauthorised erection of a new stables and planning application to further expand the business currently under consideration by the Local Planning Authority. The application fails to demonstrate that the loss of this site for equestrian and other associated uses would not result in an adverse impact on the existing business and give rise to further pressure to development the open area to the north-east. While also putting pressure on the development of the open countryside, the scheme itself would result in an adverse impact to the character of the area by reason of its poor layout, finish and landscaping, including the loss of the existing Cornish hedge boundary. As a whole, the development would fail to create the conditions in which the existing business can expand and adapt without harming the character and appearance of adjoining open countryside and would fail to promote local distinctiveness and preserve the existing landscape qualities. The proposed development therefore results in conflict with the aims and intentions of policies 1, 2, 5, 12 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 8, 81, 84, 130 and 174 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021. 2 The alignment of the boundary hedge to the west of the proposed access precludes forward visibility of the access for approaching vehicles, and the emerging visibility from the access onto the highway is inadequate taking into account the speeds of passing vehicles.

The proposed development would introduce a new unrestricted residential dwelling into the open countryside for which there are no special circumstances for justification. The dwelling would not be in a sustainable location, having particular regard to the lack of accessibility to services and facilities available locally and would give rise to dependence of future occupants on the private motor vehicle in terms of accessing such services and facilities. The proposed development would create a significantly larger and more substantial building with a greater physical presence within this sensitive location.

The estate has a spacious and open appearance which has arisen from a generous layout and low density with dwellings being served with front and rear gardens. The proposed development would be at odds with the established character and appearance of the estate and would fail to respect its form and traditional pattern of development. The proposed development is considered an intrusive and overbearing form of development which would result in harm to visual and residential amenity by reason of its cramped and contrived form. The standard of living space and private amenity space that could be provided within this constricted site would be poor. In addition the proximity of the windows on the eastern elevation as indicated on drawing no J80711 to the rear garden of number 60 would result in unacceptable overlooking of the host dwelling.

The building is not considered to be a suitably constructed, redundant, rural building which would be considered appropriate to retain, and its conversion to residential use would clearly not lead to an enhancement to the immediate setting on a site which is visible from the nearby rural highway. The addition of new openings and further domestic paraphernalia on associated land will fundamentally alter the perception of the building in the setting, such that it will be recognised as an incongruous residential form which will harm the strong, rural characteristics of this landscape of high scenic beauty, further detracting from the character and appearance of the traditional residential dwellings and conversion schemes in the vicinity.

Unsupported by any special circumstances, the provision of a new dwelling in this location represents an undesirable and sporadic form of unsustainable development which would harmfully domesticate the distinctive rural landscape character. The site is subject to special protection through its designation within the Camborne and Redruth Mining District World Heritage Site, and the remains of the existing structure are an attribute of the heritage asset. The works, which go far beyond consolidation, would result in harm to the authenticity of the attribute, leading to harm to the Outstanding Universal Value of the World Heritage Site. The resulting harm to the authenticity and integrity of the Outstanding Universal Value of the World Heritage Site would not be wholly exceptional nor would there be any overriding public benefits.

Furthermore, the site does not constitute previously developed land. Given the above, the development represents an undesirable expansion of the built form into the adjoining countryside, which would lead to visual harm through the erosion of the character and appearance of the natural environment as well as failing to demonstrate an understanding of the setting. In the absence of any sufficient special circumstances which justify residential development in this context, the proposal does not represent sustainable development and is contrary to policies 1, 2, 3, 12, 21, 23 and 24 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 8 and 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019. 2 The proposal will incur harm to the setting of a grade II listed heritage asset as well as impacting upon the character and special interest of the World Heritage Site.

The step down in the roof height would be seen as an awkward and incongruous addition that would neither reflect nor respect the form of the existing dwelling. The proposal would cause less than substantial harm to the special interest and significance of Conservation Area. In these circumstances, paragraph 196 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019 (NPPF) states that the harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal. The benefit of a partial raising of the roof would not sufficiently offset the adverse impacts upon the character of the Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore fail to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Conservation Area.

In addition, there would be significant overshadowing of neighbouring properties and of the courtyard. The proposal represents poor design in terms of resultant roof shape and the poor relationship between neighbouring properties gives rise to a poor level of amenity and substandard living environment for all occupiers.

The proposal would provide a poor standard of living and amenity space both internally and externally within the constricted site and is poorly designed resulting in visual harm. As a result, the proposal is considered to constitute a poor-quality form of development which would have an adverse visual impact and would result in a poor residential environment for future occupants contrary to the aims and intentions set out within Policies 1, 2 and 12 of the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030, paragraphs 8 and 130 of the NPPF 2021 and Policies LUD5 and LUD7 of the Ludgvan Neighbourhood Development Plan. 2 The proposal by reason of the allocated parking being to utilise the existing garage across the other side of the B3309 from the application site would fail to demonstrate safe and suitable access.

The application site is not an allocated site for residential development and nor does not constitute windfall development, rounding-off of a settlement, infill development or fall within the exceptions for residential development in the countryside under Policy 7. Planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. The development would bring forward significant benefits including the provision of housing, with much needed affordable homes, economic benefits, the link road and its associated benefits. However, given the presence of a five-year housing supply and up to date Development Plan, there is no overriding requirement or justification that these benefits should be delivered on this particular site in advance of allocation within a neighbourhood plan, particularly given the harm that this proposal would cause to the environment as detailed in reason 2 below. The proposed development is contrary to Policies 1, 3 and 7 and of the Cornwall Local Plan; the aims and intentions of paragraphs of paragraphs 2, 12, and 15 of the National Planning Policy Framework; and the long standing fundamental of the UK planning system namely utilising a plan led approach to development 2 The northern housing site and link road would intrude into the open countryside harming the distinctive landscape character and visual amenity of the area. The A39 currently forms a strong edge limiting the spread of the built-up area of the settlement. The development breaches this clearly defined edge. The northern housing site would relate to Bodieve Village rather than Wadebridge and viewed in that context, would be significant in its scale. This harm is not outweighed by the benefits of the proposal in its submitted form and is therefore considered contrary to Policies 2, 7 and 23 of the Cornwall Local Plan and saved policy ENV1 and the aims and intentions of paragraphs 127 and 170 of the National Planning Policy Framework. 3 In the absence of a mechanism to secure the long-term provision of affordable housing, open space, educational infrastructure, primary care contributions for which there is evidence of an identified need, and on and off-site highways works, the proposal is considered to be contrary to the CC Document - Guidance on s106 Planning Obligations for Education Provision (April 2012), a guide to planning contributions and health care provision in relation to primary care premises, and Cornwall Local Plan Policies 8, 13, 16, 27, and 28; and paragraphs 8, 62, 91, 94, 96, 102, 103, 108 and 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework. 4 The application fails the statutory derogation tests as it would introduce a disturbance to foraging and commuting bats and there is no imperative reason of overriding public interest for the development.

This route, on the section between site and pub, includes requirement for pedestrians to cross a bridge which in narrow in width and provides no place for refuge. An alternative and longer route is provided for pedestrians via a pavement proposed along the front of the site, dismantled railway, Camel Trail and pub but this route is much more convoluted, longer in distance and less desirable. This scheme would create a desire line for pedestrians that is not suitable and safe for all users, including those with mobility constraints such as wheelchairs and pushchairs, which is contrary to Policy 27 of the Cornwall Local Plan and paragraph 108 of the National Planning Policy Framework. 2 The application site is divorced from any settlement in a location with poor accessibility to necessary daily services and facilities.

The proposed development fails therefore to provide a safe and suitable access. Whilst this could be overcome through a revised access arrangement; this would necessitate the removal of a section of an historic wall on the western boundary of the site. This would result in a compromise to the wall which is considered to represent a non-designated heritage asset. The wall appears on historic mapping, and is one of a number of wall features that are referenced as enclosures within the Poughill Conservation Area Management Plan 2010. The wall arrangement functions as a clear distinction, narrowing from the newer development to the north of the settlement, down into the historic core of Poughill.  The loss of walling required to facilitate a safe access would result in the loss of historic fabric and its appearance would not be akin to the established local trend and will erode the historic enclosure failing to preserve the character and appearance of the Poughill Conservation Area.
