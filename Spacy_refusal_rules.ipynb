The proposed development by reason of its siting would visually compete with the host dwelling  and introduce an inappropriate and overly dominant feature within the street scene, harming the visual amenity of the immediate surroundings. As such,  the proposal  is contrary to Policy 12 of the Cornwall Local Plan 2010-2030, adopted November 2016, together with the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, with particular  reference to Paragraph 127.   \n",
       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The proposal for two dwellings outside any settlement  and without any special justification results in an unsustainable form of development in the countryside.  The accessibility of the location in accessing modes  of transport other  than the private car is poor which will result in reliance on private  cars for the majority of trips reinforcing the unsustainable  location of the development.  The proposal  is therefore contrary  to Cornwall Local Plan 2010-2030  policies 1, 3, 7 and 27, St Agnes Neighbourhood  Development  Plan policies 1 and 2 and the aims at paragraphs 8 and 79 of the National Planning Policy Framework.   \n",
