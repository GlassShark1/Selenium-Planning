The proposal  would  represent a residential unit of accommodation in the countryside where no special justification  has been satisfactorily demonstrated. As a consequence the proposed development is considered to represent undesirable, unsustainable, sporadic  residential development which is beyond any defined development limit eroding the character and appearance of this part of the Area of Great Landscape Value.

This is therefore contrary to Policy 2, 12 and 23 of The Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010-2030 and paragraph 127 and 170 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.              \n",
       "2  The proposed development raises direct conflict with the requirements  of adopted policy  in the Cornwall Local Plan as the site is clearly  located in the open countryside where new homes will only be permitted  where there are special circumstances, none of which have been identified in this particular  case.  The proposed development would clearly  erode  the rural character of this location by introducing further built development  that would  result in material harm to the character and appearance of the countryside, thus not conserving  the landscape  character and natural  beauty of the AONB AONB in this location.  The site is not a sustainable  or accessible location for a new dwelling and the development  would therefore  be contrary to development plan policy and cause material  environmental harm  to the rural character  of the area, contrary to policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 12, 23 and 27 in the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 79, 108, 110, 170 a...   \n",

The proposed development by reason of its siting would visually compete with the host dwelling  and introduce an inappropriate and overly dominant feature within the street scene, harming the visual amenity of the immediate surroundings. As such,  the proposal  is contrary to Policy 12 of the Cornwall Local Plan 2010-2030, adopted November 2016, together with the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, with particular  reference to Paragraph 127.   \n",

The accessibility of the location in accessing modes  of transport other  than the private car is poor which will result in reliance on private  cars for the majority of trips reinforcing the unsustainable  location of the development.  The proposal  is therefore contrary  to Cornwall Local Plan 2010-2030  policies 1, 3, 7 and 27, St Agnes Neighbourhood  Development  Plan policies 1 and 2 and the aims at paragraphs 8 and 79 of the National Planning Policy Framework.   \n",

The proposal  would  represent a residential unit of accommodation in the countryside where no special justification  has been satisfactorily demonstrated. As a consequence the proposed development is considered to represent undesirable, unsustainable, sporadic  residential development which is beyond any defined development limit eroding the character and appearance of this part of the Area of Great Landscape Value.

       "2  The proposed development raises direct conflict with the requirements  of adopted policy  in the Cornwall Local Plan as the site is clearly  located in the open countryside where new homes will only be permitted  where there are special circumstances, none of which have been identified in this particular  case.  The proposed development would clearly  erode  the rural character of this location by introducing further built development  that would  result in material harm to the character and appearance of the countryside, thus not conserving  the landscape  character and natural  beauty of the AONB AONB in this location.  The site is not a sustainable  or accessible location for a new dwelling and the development  would therefore  be contrary to development plan policy and cause material  environmental harm  to the rural character  of the area, contrary to policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 12, 23 and 27 in the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 and paragraphs 79, 108, 110, 170 a...   \n",

The proposed development by reason of its siting would visually compete with the host dwelling  and introduce an inappropriate and overly dominant feature within the street scene, harming the visual amenity of the immediate surroundings. As such,  the proposal  is contrary to Policy 12 of the Cornwall Local Plan 2010-2030, adopted November 2016, together with the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019, with particular  reference to Paragraph 127.   \n",

The accessibility of the location in accessing modes  of transport other  than the private car is poor which will result in reliance on private  cars for the majority of trips reinforcing the unsustainable  location of the development.  The proposal  is therefore contrary  to Cornwall Local Plan 2010-2030  policies 1, 3, 7 and 27, St Agnes Neighbourhood  Development  Plan policies 1 and 2 and the aims at paragraphs 8 and 79 of the National Planning Policy Framework.   \n",

The site is not a sustainable or accessible location for a new dwelling and the development would therefore be contrary to development plan policy and cause material environmental harm to the rural character of the area, contrary to policies 1, 2, 3, 7, 12, 23 and 27 in the Cornwall Local Plan Strategic Policies 2010 - 2030 \""
